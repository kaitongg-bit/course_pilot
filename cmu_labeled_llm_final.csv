48324,Structural Design 2: Materials and Analysis,"This course introduces fundamental concepts of static equilibrium and stability of structures. In contrast to conventional methods of learning structures that are based on numerical calculation and analysis of stresses in materials, this course explores a new geometric approach to understanding the relationship between form and forces of structures through graphic statics, a graphical method of visualizing, designing and analyzing equilibrium. By using geometry as the common language between architecture and structure, the students will explore new ways of shaping structural form by drawing and manipulating the geometry of forces. Through a series of lab exercises, the students will learn how to construct form and force diagrams used in graphic statics, and learn how the behavior of basic structural systems can be understood through such representations. The lab exercises are complemented by group design projects, where the students have the opportunity to apply the concepts and principles learned in the lab to design and build physical structural models that will be loaded to failure. No prior knowledge is required for this course.

48367,Material Histories,"Materials affect the way we engage with a building and carry cultural meanings connected with complex histories, deeply and at times messily intertwined with the social, political and ecological context. In this seminar we will look at the history of the architecture of the last two centuries by following the thread of the history of materials. We will discuss the ways in which buildings of the past and the practice of architecture were affected by which materials were available, how they were produced, and the craft required to work them. We will reflect on how architects interpreted, manipulated, or added to those meanings through their own work. Materials' lifecycles and the networks of extraction, production, transportation, and reuse had an impact on the built environment in the past, just as they do today. We will learn from historical examples to assess the consequences of the choices we make as designers. Finally, we will critically engage with the presence of history as a layer of complexity embedded in the material itself - an effect that is compounded in the practice of reuse of materials with patina, marked from their past use.","['materials', 'architecture', 'history', 'craft', 'production', 'reuse', 'patina', 'complexity', 'design', 'consequences solutionmaterials']",architecture,intermediate

With this reality as our starting point, in this course we examine the complex intersections of ethics, power and space that often shape architects' choices. How would you respond if a major client demanded that you use materials you know create toxic landscapes and long-term environmental harm? Should architects unionize their labor? Would you take a job renovating an old sugar plantation?

To address the urgent need for climate protection, architects should scrutinize the enduring material system and practices and seek simple, adaptive, and constructive solutions that enable ongoing change. The seminar course examines existing material supply chains through archival research, and mapping material sourcing and flows to explore alternative approaches to material transparency and circular methods. Students will also develop design-research and physical prototypes through reusing building components and designing for disassembly using carbon-neutral, regenerative, and waste materials.

We begin with 19th-century landscapes—rural and urban—that set the stage for the 1910 Mexican Revolution, then move through the post-revolutionary period, when arts and architecture played a vital role in shaping a new national identity. As we move through the century, we examine both avant-garde design movements and the everyday vernacular built environment. Case studies range from elite projects—such as upper-class suburbs designed by leading architects—to working-class environments, including informal settlements created by anonymous ""squatters."" Finally, we will address the mounting environmental challenges that defined the late 20th century and continue into the 21st.

It is organized chronologically and will examine the impact of indigenous philosophical principles on the organization of villages, capital cities, and religious centers. The course will begin in the Indus Valley where complex urban planning along with public and private architecture flourished from 2600-1900 BCE. We will examine South Asian Hindu and Buddhist cave monasteries as well as freestanding Hindu temples and identify the salient architectural forms that identify each type. We will then move to China where the earliest villages were arranged according to ideas about nature and the organizing system of fengshui. By the earliest Chinese dynastic period, urban planning and building placement were beginning to be codified according to Confucian and Daoist ideals. Later Chinese imperial centers were consciously designed according to Confucian regularity and hierarchy in order to make visual statements about power. We will then move to consider urban organization and Buddhist temples in China, Korea to Japan where South Asian and Eurasian models were adopted and adapted. The examination of the Japanese warrior culture will include castles, new ideas in residential architecture, the Pleasure Quarters, and retirement villas. Contemporary architecture will be addressed through individual and group projects that will investigate specific structures and situate the buildings within the cultural and historic circumstances that led to their creation.","['solutionasian architecture', 'indigenous philosophy', 'hindu temples', 'buddhist monasteries', 'fengshui', 'confucianism', 'daoism', 'imperial centers', 'japanese warrior culture']",architecture,intermediate

48519,Architecture Design Studio: Thesis II/ Independent Project,"Architecture, as a mode of thought and expression, extends far beyond definitions of construction or technique. It operates at thresholds between inside and outside, matter and meaning, presence and absence, and shapes experience through an unfolding dialogue among body, city, land, memory, and the unseen. As such, architecture reimagines how we engage with the world, human and non-human alike, through acts of translation, interpretation, and situated care. In doing so, it opens a pluriversal field where multiple ways of knowing, dwelling, and becoming can coexist. It is within this expanded framework that the thesis design studio operates. Emphasizing critical engagement with perception, history, and representation, students are invited to challenge assumptions, explore contextual meaning, and cultivate an ethical design process. Through ongoing dialogue, presentations, and critique, the studio explores the intersection of theory and practice, the pragmatic and the poetic, the habitable and the mythological. Students begin by situating their interests within broader cultural and historical frameworks, leading to a deep investigation into architectural representation, across media, scales, and sensibilities, to transform ideas into communicable form. Projects evolve through layered methods, from interpretive artefacts to traditional drawings, culminating in a comprehensive architectural vision that is both poetic and rigorous.","['architecture', 'thesis', 'design studio', 'critical engagement', 'perception', 'history', 'representation', 'ethical design', 'dialogue']",architecture,advanced

The elective is an opportunity for any student to join the spring ""build"" activity for 9 units. In this semester, we will again work campus constituents to improve the quality of life on campus through engaging design intervention(s). The project is fully funded, and the expectation is that the project will be turned over to the campus community by the last day of classes in the spring semester. During the fall, the Building Integration Option Studio (BIOS) students envisioned a farmer's market for Hazelwood Green creating design proposals at three scales-XL-M-XS. These design proposals for ""XS"" components will be a potential launching point for the spring build experience. These designs are just that-launching points-they have not been considered in the context of the Carnegie Mellon campus, so design will be a critical component of the early spring.","['designbuild aso studio', 'interdisciplinary project', 'physical transformation', 'quality of life', 'campus constituents', 'design intervention', 'farmers market', 'hazelwood green', 'design proposals']",architecture,advanced
48545,Design Fabrication,"Design Fabrication is a core course that interrogates the act of making, the logics of material behavior, and the evolving landscape of contemporary fabrication methodologies . It offers an intensive, hands-on immersion into a diverse palette of materials—including timber, metal, plastic, bamboo, plywood, plaster, wire, and various natural and synthetic fibers—with the aim of cultivating a nuanced understanding of their intrinsic properties, performative behaviors, and spatial potentials. At its core, the course emphasizes formal and tectonic inquiry through the generation of intricate geometries and assemblies. These explorations are deliberately situated outside the constraints of site specificity, client directives, or contextual mandates, thereby privileging a purist approach to material expression and fabrication intelligence. Students will be introduced to an array of analog and digital fabrication techniques, including but not limited to 3D printing, CNC milling and forming, vacuum forming, pressure lamination, hydraulic pressing, casting, weaving, and detail development for disassembly-oriented systems. Through iterative processes of making, the course nurtures tacit knowledge and intuitive sensibilities—both essential to advancing a ""thinking-through-making"" design ethos. The pedagogical trajectory follows a progressive sequence—Design - Tooling - Detailing - Prototyping - enabling students to rigorously interrogate material performance and assembly logic. Emphasis is placed on the careful selection and synthesis of materials and fabrication strategies to yield inventive formal articulations across local, regional, and global contexts.","['design fabrication', 'material behavior', 'contemporary methodologies', 'hands-on immersion', 'material properties', 'formal inquiry', 'tectonic inquiry', 'intricate geometries', 'analog techniques', 'digital fabrication']",architecture,advanced

48554,Entangled: Remaking Nature from the Picturesque to the Hypernatural,"This seminar examines the entwined relationship between nature and culture, challenging the false dichotomy that separates them. By tracing how concepts of nature, landscape, and ecology are culturally constructed and aesthetically represented, the course reveals how human imagination has shaped — and been shaped by — the natural world. Drawing from architecture, art, philosophy, and environmental theory, students will critically engage with how cultural narratives inform our understanding of the environment, and how design practices reflect, reinforce, or resist those views. Emphasizing the role of creative expression in the age of the Anthropocene, the course explores how both wild and artificial systems are represented in art and architecture. How the images we create influence how we see the world. Theories such as deep ecology, natureculture, biopolitics, and ecofeminism frame discussions on the ecological responsibilities of designers. Ultimately, students will investigate how aesthetics not only reflect but actively construct our environmental realities, opening space for more ethical, responsive, and imaginative ecological futures.","['entangled', 'nature', 'culture', 'aesthetics', 'environmental theory', 'anthropocene', 'art', 'architecture', 'ecology', 'design']",architecture,advanced

Social constructs can be defined as formless or the informe, as coined by George Bataille; an operational existence. In expanding the one's idea of operating, the use of formless allows us to consider the indeterminate. The indeterminate for our purpose in exploring context relative to spatial and cultural traditions. Within social and political space, traditions become spatial operators. How can we spatialize and draw traditions, rituals, and narratives? We will investigate the means and methods of representation relative to the formless and the built environment.

This is a hands-on, skill-building course about learning how to translate a conceptual design intent into a computational structural model, then apply material and boundary condition constraints to analyze and understand structural behavior. These learning goals are achieved through three components: lab exercises, workshops and group design projects. Through a series of lab exercises, the students will learn the fundamental structural properties of standard construction materials (masonry, steel, concrete and timber), and learn how to perform basic calculations to understand the behavior of simple structures made of those materials under various loading conditions. Lab exercises are accompanied by hands-on workshops, where the students learn a specific computational tool or skill that will enable them to translate the lessons learned from the lab exercises into a computational design environment. The knowledge learned from the labs, together with the skills gained from the workshops, are then synthesized into group projects where the students will have an opportunity to apply and test what they have learned. Basic knowledge of statics and structural design is expected, and the students are assumed to have taken Structural Design 1 at CMU or an equivalent, introductory structural design course from another institute.

The course will begin in the Indus Valley where complex urban planning along with public and private architecture flourished from 2600-1900 BCE. We will examine South Asian Hindu and Buddhist cave monasteries as well as freestanding Hindu temples and identify the salient architectural forms that identify each type. We will then move to China where the earliest villages were arranged according to ideas about nature and the organizing system of fengshui. By the earliest Chinese dynastic period, urban planning and building placement were beginning to be codified according to Confucian and Daoist ideals. Later Chinese imperial centers were consciously designed according to Confucian regularity and hierarchy in order to make visual statements about power. We will then move to consider urban organization and Buddhist temples in China, Korea to Japan where South Asian and Eurasian models were adopted and adapted. The examination of the Japanese warrior culture will include castles, new ideas in residential architecture, the Pleasure Quarters, and retirement villas. Contemporary architecture will be addressed through individual and group projects that will investigate specific structures and situate the buildings within the cultural and historic circumstances that led to their creation.","['solutionasian architecture', 'indigenous philosophy', 'hindu temples', 'buddhist monasteries', 'fengshui', 'confucianism', 'daoism', 'imperial centers', 'japanese warrior culture']",architecture,advanced
48647,Materiality and Construction Systems,"This course introduces students to contemporary methods of construction and draws attention to the materialization of architectural intent. It foregrounds the historical, technological, and conceptual basis of construction systems to understand the building as a process and cultural artifact. The course provides an overview of established and emerging construction systems to reveal how and why building processes are utilized. Materials and methods of construction are positioned as both constraints and affordances, each with distinct spatial, structural, environmental, economic, and aesthetic concerns. Through lectures, readings, and detailed analysis, students will learn about the construction of fundamental architectural conditions, including foundations, walls, frames, envelopes, and roofs. Production methods, spanning the vernacular to the digital will introduce cultures of building and design for manufacturing considerations.","['construction systems', 'architectural intent', 'building process', 'materialization', 'historical basis', 'technological basis', 'conceptual basis', 'spatial concerns', 'structural concerns', 'environmental concerns']",architecture,advanced

48667,Material Histories,"Materials affect the way we engage with a building and carry cultural meanings connected with complex histories, deeply and at times messily intertwined with the social, political and ecological context. In this seminar we will look at the history of the architecture of the last two centuries by following the thread of the history of materials. We will discuss the ways in which buildings of the past and the practice of architecture were affected by which materials were available, how they were produced, and the craft required to work them. We will reflect on how architects interpreted, manipulated, or added to those meanings through their own work. Materials' lifecycles and the networks of extraction, production, transportation, and reuse had an impact on the built environment in the past, just as they do today. We will learn from historical examples to assess the consequences of the choices we make as designers. Finally, we will critically engage with the presence of history as a layer of complexity embedded in the material itself - an effect that is compounded in the practice of reuse of materials with patina, marked from their past use.","['materials', 'architecture', 'history', 'craft', 'production', 'reuse', 'patina', 'complexity', 'design', 'consequences solutionmaterials']",architecture,advanced

48692,Shaping Daylight Through Simulation and Virtual Reality,"Light is one of the critical aspects of valued architectural spaces, influencing ambiance, the overall atmosphere, and occupant perception, whether positively or negatively. In this course, we will explore the quantities and qualities of light. We will study how we can design with and for light while understanding the paradox of lighting design¿that it is both science and art. Digital design and simulation tools will be augmented with virtual reality (VR) to extend quantitative measurements of lighting to include qualitative aspects of light such as its influence on occupants' subjective impressions of a space, wellbeing and comfort.","['light', 'architecture', 'simulation', 'virtual reality', 'design', 'quantities', 'qualities', 'science', 'art', 'occupant perception']",architecture,advanced
48698,Material Regeneration: Towards Non-extractive Tectonics,"The current energy crisis and climate change have impelled architects to challenge many standing assumptions in material culture and rethink the relationship between materials, the environment, construction methods, and labor. To address the urgent need for climate protection, architects should scrutinize the enduring material system and practices and seek simple, adaptive, and constructive solutions that enable ongoing change. The seminar course examines existing material supply chains through archival research, and mapping material sourcing and flows to explore alternative approaches to material transparency and circular methods. Students will also develop design-research and physical prototypes through reusing building components and designing for disassembly using carbon-neutral, regenerative, and waste materials. This bottom-up and hands-on approach encourages students to create ethical and ecological design criteria while experimenting with innovative construction methods and tectonics.",['no sentences'],architecture,advanced

48701,Entangled: Remaking Nature from the Picturesque to the Hypernatural,"This seminar examines the entwined relationship between nature and culture, challenging the false dichotomy that separates them. By tracing how concepts of nature, landscape, and ecology are culturally constructed and aesthetically represented, the course reveals how human imagination has shaped — and been shaped by — the natural world. Drawing from architecture, art, philosophy, and environmental theory, students will critically engage with how cultural narratives inform our understanding of the environment, and how design practices reflect, reinforce, or resist those views. Emphasizing the role of creative expression in the age of the Anthropocene, the course explores how both wild and artificial systems are represented in art and architecture. How the images we create influence how we see the world. Theories such as deep ecology, natureculture, biopolitics, and ecofeminism frame discussions on the ecological responsibilities of designers. Ultimately, students will investigate how aesthetics not only reflect but actively construct our environmental realities, opening space for more ethical, responsive, and imaginative ecological futures.","['entangled', 'nature', 'culture', 'aesthetics', 'environmental theory', 'anthropocene', 'art', 'architecture', 'ecology', 'design']",architecture,advanced

48706,Urban Design Studio II: Urban Systems,"Optimistic assessments about Pittsburgh's livability mask a complicated reality where prospects for health and well-being are starkly differentiated along lines of race, class, and gender. Environmental harms, underpinned by the ongoing legacies of industrial production, extraction, and segregative planning, create a toxic combination adversely impacting human health, ecology, and community futures. These challenges necessitate multidisciplinary, collaborative, and emancipatory approaches to knowing the built environment, and community-centered methods in urban design that attend to the local histories, embodied knowledges, and political ecologies of life in toxic systems. This studio will expand on MUD students' understanding of neighborhood-scaled urban design through the examination of urban systems and systemic processes, focusing on the infrastructures of toxicity, and modes of local action against them. It will be anchored in an ongoing collaboration with North Braddock Residents For Our Future, a grassroots organization which has led the opposition to unconventional gas drilling and environmental injustice in Braddock and North Braddock and surrounding communities.","['urban design', 'pittsburgh', 'livability', 'health', 'race', 'gender', 'environmental harms', 'industrial production']",architecture,advanced
48708,Urban Design Studio IV: Commoning the City,"Commoning the City is a yearlong research-based-design thesis studio focused on social justice and community-led urban transformations, positioning design as an agent of change that can support citizens claiming their Right to the City. The first semester, taught by Stefan Gruber provides a theoretical framing and uses case study research to enable development of thesis proposals that are theoretically grounded, geographically and culturally situated, and politically informed. The second semester, taught by Jonathan Kline, supports students in rigorously exploring their hypothesis through design and writing. For their thesis projects students focus on an urban milieu of their choice, research its actors, explore its social and ecological issues, and ultimately posit a hypothesis about how urban design might support new forms of commoning. Design exploration is organized around applying patterns and systems of commoning identified in case studies to their chosen urban context to create and support new forms of community-led resource sharing.

48711,Paradigms of Research in Architecture,"Architectural ""research"" by many practitioners is often limited to precedent studies and/or intuitively evaluating alternative design solutions and materials. Deeper analytical activities risk being perceived as unnecessary overhead expenditures. On the other hand, ""architectural"" research by many scholars is often confined to laboratory settings or so esoteric that the findings are of little use to practitioners. This course challenges the false dichotomy between these two frames and provides an introduction to a wide range of research strategies including Experimental, Simulation, Quantitative, Qualitative, Correlational, Interpretive-historical, Logical Argumentation, Case Study, and Mixed Methods. Throughout the semester there will be guest lectures from faculty who will share their expertise, successful research strategies and methods, innovative ideas for future research, and the results of their current and past research. Students will apply a variety of research paradigms and methods to their research interests, improve their verbal and visual presentation skills, and prepare a research proposal presentation with a problem statement, literature review, methodology/methods, anticipated findings, and bibliography.","['architectural research', 'research strategies', 'experimental', 'simulation', 'quantitative', 'qualitative', 'correlational', 'interpretive-historical', 'logical argumentation', 'case study']",architecture,advanced
48712,Graduate Seminar 2: Issue of Global Urbanization,"Abstract: By 2050 the number of urban dweller across the world will double. The seminar is an investigation into the future of cities focusing on three existential challenges: the escalating environmental crisis, growing social inequity and technological dislocation. In the face of these wicked problems, we will address the role and agency of designers and planners, decision makers and citizens in tackling what Jeremy Rifkin describes as the Third Industrial Revolution and how to lay the foundational infrastructure for an emerging collaborative age. These issues are explored through contemporary writings and case studies that situate urban transformations in the US within a broader global context, with a specific focus on the political as articulated through the negotiation of top-down planning and bottom-up behavior of cities. The seminar course will revolves around reading reflections, in-class presentations and student moderated discussions on theories and case studies of global urbanization. This is a 3- or 6-unit course that requires attendance at one 1.5-hours class per week. The extra credits involve a more extensive final paper. Students from diverse disciplines are welcome in this seminar. Key Topics: Global Urbanization, Uneven Growth, Political Economy, Ecological Urbanism, Resilience, Cosmopolitan Localism, Smart Cities, Commons. Course Relevance: An understanding of theories and practice of urbanism in global developments. Course Goals: The seminar provides an understanding of the social, political, economic and environmental forces at play in shaping our built environment and reflects on the role and agency of designers and planners can have in building more resilient and sustainable cities.","['global urbanization', 'uneven growth', 'political economy', 'ecological urbanism', 'resilience', 'cosmopolitan localism', 'smart cities']",architecture,advanced
48713,Urban Ecology,"Urban ecology describes the complex relationships between humans and our environment and is bound by an understanding of system dynamics. Urban ecology draws from our understanding of urban settlements and the cultural values that shape them, as well as our conception of ecology as the resources and flows that support biotic systems. Urban ecology situates humans and our activities as part of a dynamic and living environment that is more continuum than a dichotomy. This class will examine the shifting regimes of urban ecology and equip students with skills and core concepts that enable them to lead or contribute to transition through design. As designers we are trained to see patterns--urban ecology asks us also to see processes and to speculate on effects and possible outcomes. This course will discuss the systems and the logics that create the patterns, and we will explore how our design process may be different when dealing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of systems design. We will learn the fundamentals of systems dynamics modeling as it applies to the design of historical and contemporary landscapes, infrastructure, and spatial practices at the macro-, meso-, and micro-scales.","['urban ecology', 'system dynamics', 'design process', 'landscape architecture', 'infrastructure', 'spatial practices', 'macro-meso-micro scales', 'patterns', 'processes', 'uncertainty']",architecture,advanced

48735,Modern Mexico: 20th Century Architecture,"This course focuses on the architectural and urban history of Mexico City in the 20th century. We begin with 19th-century landscapes—rural and urban—that set the stage for the 1910 Mexican Revolution, then move through the post-revolutionary period, when arts and architecture played a vital role in shaping a new national identity. As we move through the century, we examine both avant-garde design movements and the everyday vernacular built environment. Case studies range from elite projects—such as upper-class suburbs designed by leading architects—to working-class environments, including informal settlements created by anonymous ""squatters."" Finally, we will address the mounting environmental challenges that defined the late 20th century and continue into the 21st. Throughout the course, a central thread will be the many and often competing ways that architecture has expressed Mexican identity.

48737,Detailing Architecture,"This course examines the role of the architectural detail in the formation/ thematic development of a work of architecture and how the detail reinforces the theoretical position of the architect. Architectural detailing is often considered only a technical task, but, in fact, the detail holds the key to inspire, integrate and reinforce the architectural idea as well as the architect's intellectual/ societal position. Many scholars, historians and academics have avoided the detail as a snapshot into the design methodology of architecture. This class is an attempt to do the opposite. The course will consist of a series of weekly lectures, short readings and graphic representations to reveal how the role of detail has played an essential role in the history, evolution and development of the built environment. Lectures will attempt to reconstruct and question the history of architecture through an understanding of the detail. The emphasis of the course is on the making of architecture through an understanding of the detail as a complete assembly and how it may help to inform the whole. Though there is an emphasis on the tectonic aspects of architecture, linkages to other aspects (social, economic, political, material) and causal factors are critical to a more complete understanding of the total work and are not necessarily elaborated in this course.

48745,Design Fabrication,"Design Fabrication is a core course that interrogates the act of making, the logics of material behavior, and the evolving landscape of contemporary fabrication methodologies . It offers an intensive, hands-on immersion into a diverse palette of materials—including timber, metal, plastic, bamboo, plywood, plaster, wire, and various natural and synthetic fibers—with the aim of cultivating a nuanced understanding of their intrinsic properties, performative behaviors, and spatial potentials. At its core, the course emphasizes formal and tectonic inquiry through the generation of intricate geometries and assemblies. These explorations are deliberately situated outside the constraints of site specificity, client directives, or contextual mandates, thereby privileging a purist approach to material expression and fabrication intelligence. Students will be introduced to an array of analog and digital fabrication techniques, including but not limited to 3D printing, CNC milling and forming, vacuum forming, pressure lamination, hydraulic pressing, casting, weaving, and detail development for disassembly-oriented systems. Through iterative processes of making, the course nurtures tacit knowledge and intuitive sensibilities—both essential to advancing a """"thinking-through-making"""" design ethos. The pedagogical trajectory follows a progressive sequence—Design - Tooling - Detailing - Prototyping - enabling students to rigorously interrogate material performance and assembly logic. Emphasis is placed on the careful selection and synthesis of materials and fabrication strategies to yield inventive formal articulations across local, regional, and global contexts.","['design fabrication', 'material behavior', 'fabrication methodologies', 'hands-on immersion', 'material properties', 'intrinsic properties', 'spatial potentials', 'formal inquiry', 'tectonic inquiry', 'geometries']",architecture,advanced
48751,Lab for Cybernetics: Engaging Wicked Challenges,"The Laboratory for Cybernetics supports students engaging with wicked challenges grounded in a thesis topic or personal project, by offering concepts and materials, models and methods, networks and collaboration. Cybernetics uniquely approaches systems in terms of purpose—the purpose attributed to the system and the purpose of those who articulate the system's purpose (see https://tinyurl.com/L4C-Award). Thus, Cybernetics demands explanations for system behaviors as well as responsibility for our own behaviors and the interventions we design. The course project is a design brief that is entered into an competition for a $5K toward for implementation. The primary award criterion is to increase the total number of choices.

But what is a photograph?"" Photography is a complicated and slippery medium to define, widely employed, in multiple contexts, for a variety of purposes. Nonetheless, despite its mutability, the photographic image has its own inherent specific characteristics that transcend equipment and process. After almost two centuries of vastly changing technologies, so many of us are still engaged in the very same act of using a device to put a frame around a portion of the world and freeze it in time. So, what is it we are doing? What does it mean? How does the resulting image function? And how do the images we consume shape what we think we understand about ourselves, the world, and the other people in it? In this course, students will consider the ideas of writers, thinkers, curators such as Stephen Shore, Gerry Badger, Charlotte Cotton, Thierry de Duve, Jan Baetens, David Campany, Mark Alice Durant, and Kate Palmer Albers, amongst others.

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth. Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions. The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace. It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced. It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach). Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU). The goal of the project in Mini 1 is to understand the industry dynamics and competitive set, to identify a market based on use of an ""agile needs-driven innovation"" methodology (job + job executor + context defines the market), and to segment the market based on identification of ""jobs to be done"" by the job executors. These are the drivers for identification of a successful Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a market entry point, and development of a differentiating strategy and self-sustained growth strategy.","['innovation', 'commercialization', 'open innovation', 'market strategy', 'market dynamics', 'agile innovation', 'mvp', 'market segmentation']",business & management,advanced

45831,Pricing Strategy,"Course Prerequisites: Marketing Management and Probability & Statistics or their equivalents are required. Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In today's hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions","['pricing strategy', 'marketing management', 'probability statistics', 'microeconomics', 'statistics', 'psychology', 'costs', 'customer', 'competition', 'pricing practices']",business & management,advanced

45860,Demand Management & Price Optimization,"Matching supply with demand is an enormous challenge for firms: excess supply is costly, inadequate supply irritates customers and can yield lost revenue opportunities. In this course we will explore how firms can improve the operational management of the demand for their products (goods or services) to more effectively align it with their supply. This demand management orientation complements the traditional supply chain management view of operations management. We will mainly focus on managing demand to meet supply with the goal of maximizing (net) revenue, rather than managing supply to meet demand with the goal of minimizing cost. The former view is particularly relevant when the firm's supply is fixed or relatively inflexible, as in service or service-like operations. We will also explore opportunities to jointly manage supply and demand with the goal of maximizing margin.","['demand management', 'price optimization', 'supply alignment', 'revenue maximization', 'operational management', 'fixed supply', 'service operations', 'margin maximization', 'cost minimization']",business & management,advanced
45861,Six Sigma Tools and Techniques,"To understand six sigma we must understand its underlying philosophy, that of the modern quality movement. Therefore we will first compare and contrast the ideas of various quality ""gurus,"" examining the different ways to define and measure quality. In most cases, the goal should be to design and maintain a process which is in statistical control, producing with the ""best"" nominal value, and with a minimum of variation. How to determine what is ""best"" is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider some of the issues surrounding successful adoption of quality improvement initiatives finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs, including six sigma. We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools supporting quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class. We will conclude with a focused discussion of specific six-sigma ideas and techniques, exploring its similarities and differences as compared to traditional quality programs. At the conclusion of the course you will understand the six-sigma framework, and be very comfortablewith its technical tools. Other topics we will consider include process capability, setting tolerances, process control, quality in service operations, evaluatory techniques such as the House of Quality, and ISO 9000 certification.","['six sigma', 'quality movement', 'quality gurus', 'statistical control', 'taguchi loss function', 'quality improvement', 'quality design', 'control charts', 'design of experiments', 'process capability']",business & management,advanced
45862,Supply Chain Management,"A supply chain is a network of facilities and distribution options that performs the functions of procurement of materials, transformation of these materials into intermediate and finished products, and the distribution of these finished products to customers (Ganeshan and Harrison, 1995). However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations. Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011). SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods. Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost. Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals. This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics. Throughout, this course illustrates qualitative as well as quantitative principles and business analytics applied to real SCM challenges ¿ the tools of SCM ¿ with an emphasis on approaches to increase responsiveness to manage risk.","['supply chain', 'management', 'network', 'coordination', 'production', 'inventory', 'location', 'transportation', 'distribution', 'strategic']",business & management,advanced
45864,Operations Strategy,"The goal of this course is to provide conceptual frameworks and analytical tools to optimize key decisions in formulating operations strategy. In particular, we will study: (1) process & resource strategy, and (2) supply chain & outsourcing strategy. The intended audience for this course is those who seek better understanding of the connection between operations and strategy, including an operations manager, a general or marketing manager (who interfaces with operations), a consultant, and an entrepreneur. Operations strategy enables the execution of corporate/business strategy (i.e., how to best deliver the value proposition), and it involves configuring and developing resources & processes used to design, produce, distribute, and deliver goods and/or services. Operations strategy must be aligned with other functional strategies, and therefore this course is integrative in nature, drawing upon concepts introduced in other disciplines such as strategy, marketing, finance, and organizational behavior. This course is the highest-level elective in the operations concentration, and it is also counted for the strategy concentration. Operations strategy must build on good understanding of day-to-day operations management as well as corporate/business strategy. The strategic decisions studied in this course require a detailed analysis and understanding of the underlying operations. Thus, this course may have a greater amount of concreteness and detail than a corporate strategy class. The class format is a combination of lectures and case discussions. For class discussions, the instructional format will be a dialogue between the students and the instructor, tending toward the Socratic approach, should the dialogue languish. We will also play online live simulation games, followed by debriefing and discussions of different strategies chosen.

It begins with some history and institutional description. When did the ""financialization"" of the energy industry begin? Why? What exactly does this mean? Has it been an unambiguously good thing, or has it led to some unanticipated side effects (e.g., bubbles) that prompt introspection? The course goes on to explore what makes ""energy finance"" distinct from other areas of corporate finance. Examples include distinctive financing structures such as project finance and tax-based equity vehicles, the ubiquitous role played by government regulation and tax policy, forms of business organization known asMaster Limited Partnerships(MLPs), ""energy accounting and valuation,"" and a variety of financial modeling issues that are often referred to asreal option models. The course will not be overly technical. It will be more of a broad overview than an in-depth technical analysis of a particular topic. It places more emphasis oncorporate financethat on capital markets. The course is relevant for careers in the energy industry and the energy-related finance industry, as well as careers in supporting industries such as consulting.

45950,AI for Smarter Operational Decisions,"This course explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods can enhance operational decision- making. It builds on Operations Research (OR) — the discipline of analytics-based decision- making — and integrates Machine Learning (ML) with optimization to improve business decisions. Traditional OR methods have separated the process of going from data to decisions into sequentially solved stages. For example, we first predict the demand, after which we will optimize a production schedule against the prediction. This separation potentially weakens the outcomes but has been necessary to keep each step manageable in terms of model size and computation. Bridging the stages by integrating their respective model can lead to better outcomes, e.g., cost savings, higher productivity, or lower risk. The recent development and application of machine learning methods to business problems have spawned a closer integration of learning (ML) and decision making (OR). These range from incorporating optimization methods into ML (e.g., via decision loss) to embedding linearized predictive ML model into optimization. These topics are still under active development by the research community and industry. We will explore some of the more established integrations of ML and OR; where business cases are available, we will use them. Otherwise, we will assess the potential business value on synthetic datasets. The lectures combine theory and methodology with hands-on cases. We will use Python to build our ML models and our Gurobi optimization.

Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.","['evolution', 'natural selection', 'genetic drift', 'phenotypic trade-offs', 'constraints', 'evolutionary dynamics', 'biological systems', 'theoretical formalism', 'modelingdocumenttitle modeling evolution']",health & life sciences,intermediate

62244,Contemporary Photo Theory,"In his 1984 review of his talk, Something about Photography, Victor Burgin writes: ""It seems reasonable to assume that the object of photography theory is, at base, the photograph. But what is a photograph""? Photography is a complicated and slippery medium to define, widely employed, in multiple contexts, for a variety of purposes. Nonetheless, despite its mutability, the photographic image has its own inherent specific characteristics that transcend equipment and process. After almost two centuries of vastly changing technologies, so many of us are still engaged in the very same act of using a device to put a frame around a portion of the world and freeze it in time. So, what is it we are doing? What does it mean? How does the resulting image function? And how do the images we consume shape what we think we understand about ourselves, the world, and the other people in it? In this course, students will consider the ideas of writers, thinkers, curators such as Stephen Shore, Gerry Badger, Charlotte Cotton, Thierry de Duve, Jan Baetens, David Campany, Mark Alice Durant, and Kate Palmer Albers, amongst others.

62360,Photographers and Photography Since World War II,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles ""Teenie"" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences.","['photography', 'visual expression', 'documentary photography', 'lewis hine', 'alfred stieglitz', 'soul reflection', 'art object', 'twentieth century', 'photographic expression']",arts & culture,intermediate

In this seminar, we critically probe such presentations and examine the political ecologies that contour these forms of urbanization through theoretically informed and historically grounded examinations of South Asia cities from the mid-19th century onwards. As a critical nexus of the effects of the global climate crisis, South Asia provides a unique and urgent case study to interrogate not just the technical but also cultural, social, political, and material dimensions of urban nature and the nature of the urban. Drawing on literature from architecture history, critical urban studies, political ecology, and environmental justice, and through close reading, analytical writing, and dialogue, we will examine how urban nature is enrolled in and reconfigured by processes of colonialism; caste, class, and gender politics; and extractive development while shaping everyday life, the built environment, cultural norms, and spatial politics. Through the examination of colonial ideologies of environmental improvement; the hygienic modernity of early 20th century planning; development in the new nation states; tropical modernism of the post-war period; neoliberal urbanization; and contemporary debates around sustainability, resilience, and smart-cities, we will understand South Asian cities as crucial sites where the project of modernity is built rather than peripheral settings where it is (imperfectly or incompletely) deployed.","['urbanization', 'south asia', 'modernity', 'urban nature', 'infrastructure', 'social inequities', 'climate catastrophe', 'colonialism', 'caste']",arts & culture,advanced

15150,Principles of Functional Programming,"An introduction to programming based on a ""functional"" model of computation. The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function. But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values. This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type. One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

84306,Latin American Politics,"The world's most unequal region is an area of contrasts. Ethnically diverse, stable and tumultuous, young and old, urban and rural, learned and illiterate, prosperous and poor, independent yet dependent. The disparities that have characterized the region since colonial times have been a permanent source of instability and the cause of numerous political and economic experiments. Social scientists have found much material to study democratic innovations, revolutions, coups, civil wars, military dictatorships, impeachments, populism, clientelism, corruption, import substitution industrialization, neoliberalism, socialism, regime changes, social movements, welfare policies, regional integration, and diversified leadership. The overarching question to be explored in this course is what forces affect the emergence, development, collapse, reemergence, and consolidation of democracy. To understand the region's present, it is necessary to study path dependence and learn how the worldviews of dominant elites evolved over time. Thus, the course centers in three historical periods. First, we will briefly examine Latin American history from its conquest to the end of World War II (1492-1945). The aim is to uncover the demographic and geographical setting with its economic, social, and political evolution. The second part centers on most of the Cold War period (1947-1978) and its combination of political and economic experiments. The third part covers the last 47 years, from the wave of transitions to democracy to current challenges to democratic consolidation. We will also address how Latin America has integrated to globalization and how the relationship with the US and China has experienced fundamental changes since the 1990s.","['latin american politics', 'democracy', 'political experiment', 'cold war', 'globalization', 'us-china relations', 'regional integration', 'social movements', 'welfare policies', 'regime changes']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84310,Policy in a Global Economy 1: International Trade and Trade Policy,"Across the globe, the longstanding consensus in favor of open trade and investment policies is being called into question.

84311,Policy in a Global Economy 2: International Macroeconomics and Finance,"The global economic and financial landscape is far from tranquil and stable. National governments must frequently respond to macroeconomic and financial shocks generated elsewhere in the world. How can governments achieve and maintain growth and stability in a world where financial chaos seems ready to emerge at any moment from the most unlikely circumstances? How can nations learn the lessons of our turbulent financial and macroeconomic history, so that they are not doomed to repeat it? This course will address these essential questions. This course will teach students the basic conceptual frameworks and models of international macroeconomics. The class will focus on the rise of international capital and financial flows in the post-war era, international macroeconomic policy trade-offs with fixed and floating exchange rates, and the economics of inflation. We will use both economic models and detailed historical case studies to investigate currency and financial crises in developed and developing countries, and we will study the costs and benefits of Europe's single currency.","['global economy', 'international macroeconomics', 'finan0nance', 'capital flows', 'exchange rates', 'inflation', 'economic models', 'currency crisis', 'single currency', 'economic history']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate

84319,Civil-Military Relations,"Why do militaries (people with guns) ever obey civilians (people without guns)? Can we have a military strong enough to protect civilians, yet not so strong as to ignore or subvert civilian authority? What is the dividing line between civilian and military spheres of activity? How much influence should civilians have on activities within the military sphere, and how much influence should the military have in the civilian sphere? How does all of this affect a state's ability to both protect itself and project power globally? Examining the theory and practice of civil-military relations in the U.S. and the world, this course explores issues related to civilian control of the military and military professionalism, including coups d'etat, military disobedience, the impact of an all-volunteer vs. conscripted force on both civilian and military decisions, public-private partnerships in the military sphere, the role of military privatization in civil-military relations, and the role of servicemembers in the political life of the community. Relying on the influential texts of Lasswell, Huntington, Feaver, and Finer, the first half of the course aims to elucidate the theory behind basic tensions between the military and civilians. The second half of the course focuses on how theory translates into practice, with a particular focus on case studies of civil-military relations in the U.S. democratic system.","['civilian control', 'military professionalism', 'coups', 'military disobedience', 'all-volunteer force', 'public-private partnerships', 'military privatization', 'servicemembers', 'political life', 'case studies']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84322,Nonviolent Conflict and Revolution,"How can everyday people promote justice, equality, and democracy? Throughout history, many have looked to armed struggle and revolutionary violence. But over the course of the last century, nonviolent ""people power"" movements- from Gandhi's salt march to the Arab Spring to Black Lives Matter- have been forces for social and political change. What are the causes, strategies, tactics, dynamics, and consequences of nonviolent conflict, and how do these differ from violent or armed conflict? When and how do unarmed ""people power"" campaigns topple repressive authoritarian regimes?

84323,War and Peace in the Contemporary Middle East,"This course examines the drivers and dynamics of war and peace in the contemporary Middle East. It is structured around a series of key debates about different facets of conflict and violence in the region, such as the causes of rebellion, the reasons resistance groups use terrorism, and the factors that facilitate peace. We will delve into competing arguments about each of these issues, applying the ideas to cases around the region. We will also examine broader regional conflicts like the Arab-Israeli dispute and Sunni-Shia confrontation. We will use a mixture of research articles and books as well as more diverse materials such as war reporting, films, and memoirs in order to create a holistic understanding of these issues.","['war', 'peace', 'middle east', 'conflict', 'rebellion', 'terrorism', 'arab-israeli dispute', 'sunni-shia confrontation', 'research']",arts & culture,intermediate
84325,Contemporary American Foreign Policy,"This course provides a survey of American foreign policy since World War I as a means of explaining why American foreign policy looks the way it does today. We will cover topics such as America's perennial battles between isolationism and internationalism, the creation of the US-led world order after 1945, the containment of communism, and anti-terrorism after 9/11. We will cover enduring and global issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, humanitarian intervention, and international economic policy, as well. Further, a main focus of the course is how foreign policy is made - the role each branch of government plays in foreign policy making, the impact of domestic politics and public opinion, and how other countries receive and react to American foreign policy. The course will use both history and data analysis to understand how foreign policy works, how it is made, and its effect both at home and abroad. A good grasp of the 20th century American and world history, and some familiarity with international relations theory are not requirements but will prove helpful. By the end of the semester, students should have acquired a broad understanding of the most important foreign policy events of the last century and have the tools to analyze foreign policy decision-making.","['american foreign policy', 'world war i', 'isolationism', 'internationalism', 'us-led world order', 'containment', 'anti-terrorism', 'climate change', 'nuclear non-prol0liferation', 'humanitarian intervention']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84327,Who Really Runs America?: Subnational Governance and Policymaking,"Most discussions of American politics revolve around the federal government, despite the fact that states and localities account for the vast majority of policymaking and elected officials in the US, overseeing such central aspects of our daily lives as education, public services, land use, infrastructure, and health care. This course examines these subnational governments (e.g., states, counties, municipalities, school districts, etc.), with a focus on how well they represent the interests and preferences of the populations they serve. We will cover topics including the forces shaping who participates in state and local government, the economics of administering these entities, and the variety of institutions structuring politics at this level along with their origins and effects. In addition, students will apply the behavioral, fiscal, and organizational perspectives discussed in class to complete a semester-long project in which they identify a problem in the Pittsburgh region or in their own community, investigate the existing obstacles to their issue being resolved, and propose a path forward.","['subnational governance', 'education', 'public services', 'land use', 'infrastructure', 'health care', 'representation', 'participation', 'economics']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate

84336,Implementing Public Policy:  From Good Idea To Reality,"Good public policy doesn't just ""happen."" Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or non-government organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it. The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agency's policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term. Study then shifts to an overview of several legal concepts and research skills applicable to federal policy and regulations. Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills enable Students to know when policy may be crafted ""from scratch"" — or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structure. Students then consider a particular public policy subcomponent, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern the federal policies created thereunder. The course culminates with Students developing and ""staffing"" a notional policy, modeled on the federal agency policy system model studied throughout the term.","['public policy', 'government behavior', 'bureaucracy', 'legal concepts', 'regulatory agencies', 'administrative law', 'federal agencies', 'policy subcomponent']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate

84341,Transnational Criminal Networks & International Security,"Since the end of the Cold War, threats to national and international security have become more varied and diffused. Some of these threats are subtle and insidious rather than overtly military in character. This course will explore the rise of transnational criminal networks, their motivations and support, and explore the threats they pose to domestic and global governance as well as to international security and stability. We cover the characteristics and methods of transnational organized crime and the governments that house them as we examine illicit, black market networks of smugglers and terrorists involved in nuclear, narcotic, high-technology and human trafficking, including state and UN efforts to trace and interdict these transactions. This class will also dive into the roles cyber space, social media, and cryptocurrency play in facilitating these networks.

84347,Congress & National Security,"While most of the discussion around US national security is around the President in his role as Commander in Chief, the divided structure of the US government means that Congress also has an important, if under-examined, role to play in US national security. This course will examine the roots and structure of Congressional power over US national security, and the debates between the executive and legislative branches, and within the legislative branch about the direction of US national security, including those areas with a particular impact on technology development and use.","['congress', 'national security', 'us government', 'executive-legislative debate', 'technology development', 'us national security', 'congressional power', 'legislative branch', 'roots of power']",business & management,intermediate
84350,A Strategist's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,"How do AI technologies influence politics, governance, and conflict? This course provides an overview of AI technologies, beginning with unpacking the term 'artificial intelligence' itself. Students will examine AI applications and their implications in political and governance contexts. The course begins with a foundational and applied understanding of machine learning, covering core concepts such as unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and embodied AI. This course takes an applied approach rooted in public policy literature and assumes no prior knowledge of the concepts or technical expertise. Following this introduction, the course explores the use of AI technologies in various political and public policy scenarios, including surveillance, defense, online information environments, political campaigns, environmental sustainability, and global trade. Students will critically examine how these technologies are deployed, their capabilities and limitations, regulatory issues, and ethical considerations, such as bias and fairness.","['ai', 'politics', 'governance', 'public policy', 'surveill011', 'defense', 'online information', 'political campaigns']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84352,Representation and Voting Rights,"What does it mean to be represented in a democracy? Who has a voice, and who is left out? This course explores political representation—both as an ideal and as a lived reality. We'll examine the design of American democratic institutions, the impact of the Voting Rights Act, and the ongoing role of courts in shaping who gets represented. A central theme will be how race and racial attitudes continue to shape political power and outcomes. Along the way, we'll ask hard questions: Does representation translate into policies that reflect public preferences? How fair are the systems we use to draw voting districts? And what are the consequences of unequal representation for the health of American democracy?","['representation', 'voting rights', 'democracy', 'political institutions', 'voting rights act', 'courts', 'race', 'political power', 'policies', 'voting districts']",design & hci,intermediate
84353,US-China Strategic Stability,"This course will explore a range of issues that create tension and competition in the US China relationship. As the two countries seek strategic stability and vie to retain or gain advantage in global influence, each country defines its success differently, and in ways that could bring it into conflict with the other. This course will examine key issues in the US-China relationship that create and exacerbate tensions, including Taiwan, cybersecurity, the AI ""race"", nuclear weapons and long range strike, and scientific cooperation, and technology development.","['us-china relationship', 'strategic stability', 'taiwan', 'cybersecurity', 'ai race', 'nuclear weapons', 'long range strike', 'scientific cooperation']",computer science & engineering,intermediate

84365,The Politics of Fake News and Misinformation,"In this course, we will examine the drivers and dynamics of misinformation, fake news, and related phenomena in social and political life. From wartime ""atrocity propaganda"" to climate denialism to false claims of election fraud, how can we characterize fake news and misinformation, and why do they often spread so widely? What are the factors that explain why people accept or reject them, and what are their consequences for our political behavior? Finally, how can they be successfully countered and combatted? In this course, we will look at these and other questions, drawing on the fast-growing body of research on the topic from a range of fields including psychology, communications, political science, and computer science. In terms of the course's structure, we will first focus on defining and characterizing fake news and misinformation, and next we will examine their production (why are they created?), consumption (why are they believed?), and consequences (what influence do they have?). Then, we will analyze the threat of misinformation in several important contexts - including COVID-19, climate change, and armed conflict - and finally we will consider research and analysis about how to best counter it. For the final assignment in the course, students will build on what they have learned throughout the semester to write an original research paper applying ideas and arguments from class to a case of fake news or misinformation that is of special interest to them.","['misinformation', 'fake news', 'propaganda', 'social media', 'political behavior', 'research', 'countermeasures', 'covid-', 'climate change', 'armed conflict']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84366,"The 21st-Century Presidency: Expanding Powers, New Challenges","The president is undisputedly at the center of the US government: the most powerful and prominent person in the country (and quite possibly the world), endowed with vast policymaking authority and broad latitude to set the national agenda. When creating the Constitution, however, the Framers devised an institutional arrangement that prioritized Congress and restricted an empowered chief executive with legal and practical constraints to prevent the president from becoming an autocrat. How did we get from there to here, and is the contemporary presidency truly as omnipotent as it appears? This course engages these questions by examining the presidency's place in the broader political system. Specifically, we will explore the president's interactions with the other branches of government, the parties, interest groups, and the public, analyzing the tools available to presidents to achieve their goals as well as the resources other actors possess to influence the chief executive and protect their own prerogatives. We will also investigate the structure and historical development of the executive branch along with the dynamics of presidential elections to assess their impact on the modern presidency. Throughout the semester, the class will incorporate case studies of presidential decision-making in critical moments to understand more fully both these individuals and the office they occupy.","['presidency', 'constitution', 'congress', 'executive branch', 'presidential elections', 'power', 'influence', 'parties', 'interest groups']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84368,Technology Ethics,"Churchill once complained that war, once ""cruel and magnificent,"" had been ""completely spoiled"" due to the involvement of scientists in creating new military weaponry. Scientific-military collaborations are hardly new, however. This course provides an introduction to the politics of technology ethics. The purpose of this course is not to instruct on what is or should be considered ethical. Rather, our aim will be to understand how ethical standpoints intersect with the political realm, creating tradeoffs for individuals and societies. Delving into historical technological controversies, we will debate current issues like the precautionary principle, technology neutrality, and individual responsibility.","['technology ethics', 'scientific-military collaboration', 'politics of ethics', 'ethical standpoints', 'tradeoffs', 'individual resp0ltibility', 'precautionary principle', 'technology neutrality', 'historical controversies', 'ethical']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate

This course examines how space-based services provide critical support to military and intelligence operations and contribute to national security more broadly. The course is designed to investigate several interrelated themes, weaving together relevant aspects of technology, strategy, and policy. The material is approached from both functional and historical perspectives, beginning with the basics of military and intelligence space operations and ending with an examination of the space- and cyber-related technical, strategic, and political challenges facing the nation today and in the foreseeable future.","['space systems', 'military operations', 'intelligence operations', 'national security', 'technology', 'strategy', 'policy', 'functional perspective', 'historical perspective', 'technical challenges']",business & management,intermediate
84383,National Cyber Policy & Strategy,"The decisions nations make in cyberspace have profound implications for both prosperity and sovereignty. The internet is a digital thread tying together peoples. The nature of our participation in this ecosystem is determined by policy makers. Cyber policy mirrors the political ethos of governments. Some nations choose to use cyber as a tool of control and repression, others construct cyber policies as key enablers of innovation and the free exchange of ideas. The translation of traditional policy objectives into a direction for cyber is often problematic. The perpetually liminal state of conflict in cyberspace adds another set of challenges for policy makers. In this course we will explore national cyber policies. We will compare approaches and explore the role of culture. In our analysis we will enumerate the attributes of effective national cyber policy and conduct postmortems on failed policies. We will examine the ethical questions faced by cyber policy makers. Every citizen has a role in cyber policy. This course is intended to prepare future policy makers and create informed citizens.","['cyber policy', 'national strategy', 'internet governance', 'innovation', 'ethics', 'cybersecurity', 'conflict', 'culture', 'postmortem']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
84387,Remote Systems and the Cyber Domain in Conflict,"For most of human history, warfare took place face-to-face or in close proximity using weapons like rocks, swords, spears, bow and arrows, and firearms. The development of technologies like missiles, drones, & the internet have changed the character of warfare by enabling actors to use lethal force & cause disruption thousands of miles away from the battlefield. Technological advancements have arguably even led to the creation of an entirely human-made domain of warfare- the cyber domain- that is distinct from the land, sea, air & space domains. This course will analyze the impact of drones & the cyber domain on international conflict. We will study the historical origins of these technologies, why & how they have spread, their use & effectiveness on the battlefield, ethical questions surrounding their use, & whether arms control is possible. How is the information revolution in computing similar & different from prior revolutions in military affairs? Are drones and the cyber domain transforming conflict by giving the offense a significant advantage over the defense, or is their offensive and destructive potential exaggerated? Is coercion possible in cyberspace, or does the attribution problem impede deterrence? Might drones actually reduce the risks of escalation in interstate conflict by removing the desire for revenge if a pilot is killed? How has the internet been weaponized to enable economic warfare and election interference? Might cyber espionage undermine the United States' military advantage, and should the US ban TikTok? Do drones decrease or increase terrorism? Is remote warfare & the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems- sometimes referred to as killer robots- inherently unethical? These are just a handful of the questions we will explore in this class. By the end of the course, students will have a grasp of the history of the information revolution & many of the key debates & theories in this field.","['remote warfare', 'cyber domain', 'drones', 'international conflict', 'information revolution', 'ethical questions', 'arms control', 'military affairs', 'election interference', 'terrorism']",computer science & engineering,intermediate
84389,Terrorism and Insurgency,"This course provides an introduction to terrorism, insurgency, and civil war, covering the causes, dynamics, consequences, and policy responses to these forms of political violence. Insurgent and terrorist groups are some of the most important actors behind security challenges across the world. Definition of these phenomena can be as contentious as the question of which policies are most appropriate to prevent, manage, and resolve the conflicts in which they take part. The course will cover the historical evolution of these forms of violence as well as recent trends. The course will also focus on groups, methods, ideologies, and organizational structures, and will address the effectiveness of different policies over time at preventing and managing these forms of violence, and the role that these policies play in overall national strategy.","['terrorism', 'insurgency', 'civil war', 'political violence', 'security challenges', 'policy responses', 'conflict management', 'ideologies', 'organizational structures']",business & management,intermediate
84390,"Social Media, Technology, and Conflict","This course will examine the role that social media and technology have had on conflict at multiple levels, both between and within nations. Interconnectedness has expanded dramatically and continues to expand, allowing the formerly disconnected individuals with shared political views, states and diaspora populations to be intimately connected. The Arab Spring uprisings were significantly influenced by the use of cell phones, social media, and text-messaging as organizing tools. Insurgent groups like the Islamic States harnessed the power of social media and emerging technologies, and now extremist groups in the US and Europe are using Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and other social media platforms to their advantage. Information war is a critical factor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as both sides work to support/exploit kinetic warfare. Social media is used both to recruit for and fund violent extremism, while the internet has become a channel for radicalizing individuals into violent ideologies. Loss of trust in media and institutions, and the proliferation of mis/disinformation, conspiracy theories, and malign information operations over social media has introduced a new dimensions to conflict and relations between individuals, small groups, non-state actors, and nation-states.","['social media', 'technology', 'conflict', 'insurgent groups', 'extremist groups', 'information war', 'recruitment', 'radicalization', 'misinformation']",business & management,intermediate
84450,Policy Seminar,"The Policy Seminar course takes a critical look at decision making in domestic politics and US foreign policy. It does so through weekly roundtable discussions with a diverse set of thought leaders. Based on intellectually significant essays that students are expected to read in advance of each class, these discussions give students an opportunity to ask probing questions about the three branches of the US government, media, embassies, advocacy groups, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. This course seeks to help students understand the responsibilities and activities that leaders and decision makers carry out on behalf of their organizations. Students are instructed in how to confidently and respectfully ask critical questions of those shaping policy. Knowing how to make linkages between relevant and related issues and asking critical questions to find answers to complex problems are significant elements in the professional development of anyone interested in taking part in the policy arena, and this course helps students hone these important skills. In requiring students to read important essays related to each class session and then step back from discussions with leaders to write analytical essays, this course teaches students how to develop strong arguments based on solid logic and credible evidence, an essential component in making democracy work.","['policy seminar', 'domestic politics', 'us foreign policy', 'thought leaders', 'government branches', 'media', 'embassies', 'advocacy groups', 'international organizations']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate

84606,Latin American Politics,"The world's most unequal region is an area of contrasts. Ethnically diverse, stable and tumultuous, young and old, urban and rural, learned and illiterate, prosperous and poor, independent yet dependent. The disparities that have characterized the region since colonial times have been a permanent source of instability and the cause of numerous political and economic experiments. Social scientists have found much material to study democratic innovations, revolutions, coups, civil wars, military dictatorships, impeachments, populism, clientelism, corruption, import substitution industrialization, neoliberalism, socialism, regime changes, social movements, welfare policies, regional integration, and diversified leadership. The overarching question to be explored in this course is what forces affect the emergence, development, collapse, reemergence, and consolidation of democracy. To understand the region's present, it is necessary to study path dependence and learn how the worldviews of dominant elites evolved over time. Thus, the course centers in three historical periods. First, we will briefly examine Latin American history from its conquest to the end of World War II (1492-1945). The aim is to uncover the demographic and geographical setting with its economic, social, and political evolution. The second part centers on most of the Cold War period (1947-1978) and its combination of political and economic experiments. The third part covers the last 47 years, from the wave of transitions to democracy to current challenges to democratic consolidation. We will also address how Latin America has integrated to globalization and how the relationship with the US and China has experienced fundamental changes since the 1990s.","['latin american politics', 'democracy', 'political experiment', 'cold war', 'globalization', 'us-china relations', 'regional integration', 'social movements', 'welfare policies', 'regime changes']",public policy & social sciences,advanced

Throughout the course, we will examine the nexus of the terrorist threat in sub-Saharan Africa, and subsequent responses from governments, multinational organizations and foreign actors. It is intended to acquaint students with the dynamics of terrorism and counterterrorism efforts in sub-Saharan Africa, and by doing so establish a solid foundation upon which further expertise can be built.","['terrorism', 'sub-saharan africa', 'terrorist groups', 'counterterrorism', 'government response', 'multinational organizations', 'foreign actors', 'terrorism dynamics']",design & hci,advanced
84619,Civil-Military Relations,"Why do militaries (people with guns) ever obey civilians (people without guns)? Can we have a military strong enough to protect civilians, yet not so strong as to ignore or subvert civilian authority? What is the dividing line between civilian and military spheres of activity? How much influence should civilians have on activities within the military sphere, and how much influence should the military have in the civilian sphere? How does all of this affect a state's ability to both protect itself and project power globally? Examining the theory and practice of civil-military relations in the U.S. and the world, this course explores issues related to civilian control of the military and military professionalism, including coups d'etat, military disobedience, the impact of an all-volunteer vs. conscripted force on both civilian and military decisions, public-private partnerships in the military sphere, the role of military privatization in civil-military relations, and the role of servicemembers in the political life of the community. Relying on the influential texts of Lasswell, Huntington, Feaver, and Finer, the first half of the course aims to elucidate the theory behind basic tensions between the military and civilians. The second half of the course focuses on how theory translates into practice, with a particular focus on case studies of civil-military relations in the U.S. democratic system.","['civilian control', 'military professionalism', 'coups', 'military disobedience', 'all-volunteer force', 'public-private partnerships', 'military privatization', 'servicemembers', 'political life', 'case studies']",public policy & social sciences,advanced

But over the course of the last century, nonviolent ""people power"" movements -- from Gandhi's salt march to the Arab Spring to Black Lives Matter -- have been forces for social and political change. What are the causes, strategies, tactics, dynamics, and consequences of nonviolent conflict, and how do these differ from violent or armed conflict? When and how do unarmed""people power"" campaigns topple repressive authoritarian regimes? This course addresses these questions and in the process engages contending theories of power, revolution, and insurgency. The course introduces students to key concepts, theories, strategies, and historical patterns of nonviolent conflict.

The course is structured around five major types of armed conflict that plague the region today - civil wars, insurgent and terrorist campaigns, enduring rivalries, regional disputes, and external interventions. We will delve into the theories of what fuels - and what resolves - each of these types of conflict, while exploring cases around the region such as the disputes in Libya, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Turkey, as well as broader clashes like the Arab Israeli conflict, Shi'a-Sunni conflict, and recent great power interventions in the region. The course will rely on a mixture of research articles and books as well as more diverse materials such as war reporting, films, and memoirs in order to give students a holistic understanding of these issues.","['war', 'peace', 'contemporary', 'middle', 'east', 'examines', 'drivers', 'north']",arts & culture,advanced

84627,Who Really Runs America?: Subnational Governance & Policymaking,"Most discussions of American politics revolve around the federal government, despite the fact that states and localities account for the vast majority of policymaking and elected officials in the US, overseeing such central aspects of our daily lives as education, public services, land use, infrastructure, and health care. This course examines these subnational governments (e.g., states, counties, municipalities, school districts, etc.), with a focus on how well they represent the interests and preferences of the populations they serve. We will cover topics including the forces shaping who participates in state and local government, the economics of administering these entities, and the variety of institutions structuring politics at this level along with their origins and effects. In addition, students will apply the behavioral, fiscal, and organizational perspectives discussed in class to complete a semester-long project in which they identify a problem in the Pittsburgh region or in their own community, investigate the existing obstacles to their issue being resolved, and propose a path forward.","['subnational governance', 'education', 'public services', 'land use', 'infrastructure', 'health care', 'representation', 'participation', 'economics']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
84641,Transnational Criminal Networks & International Security,"Since the end of the Cold War, threats to national and international security have become more varied and diffused. Some of these threats are subtle and insidious rather than overtly military in character. This course will explore the rise of transnational criminal networks, their motivations and support, and explore the threats they pose to domestic and global governance as well as to international security and stability. We cover the characteristics and methods of transnational organized crime and the governments that house them as we examine illicit, black market networks of smugglers and terrorists involved in nuclear, narcotic, high-technology and human trafficking, including state and UN efforts to trace and interdict these transactions. This class will also dive into the roles cyber space, social media, and cryptocurrency play in facilitating these networks.

84647,Congress & National Security,"While most of the discussion around US national security is around the President in his role as Commander in Chief, the divided structure of the US government means that Congress also has an important, if under-examined, role to play in US national security. This course will examine the roots and structure of Congressional power over US national security, and the debates between the executive and legislative branches, and within the legislative branch about the direction of US national security, including those areas with a particular impact on technology development and use.","['congress', 'national security', 'us government', 'executive-legislative debate', 'technology development', 'us national security', 'congressional power', 'legislative branch', 'roots of power']",business & management,advanced
84650,A Strategist's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,"How do AI technologies influence politics, governance, and conflict? This course provides an overview of AI technologies, beginning with unpacking the term 'artificial intelligence' itself. Students will examine AI applications and their implications in political and governance contexts. The course begins with a foundational and applied understanding of machine learning, covering core concepts such as unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and embodied AI. This course takes an applied approach rooted in public policy literature and assumes no prior knowledge of the concepts or technical expertise. Following this introduction, the course explores the use of AI technologies in various political and public policy scenarios, including surveillance, defense, online information environments, political campaigns, environmental sustainability, and global trade. Students will critically examine how these technologies are deployed, their capabilities and limitations, regulatory issues, and ethical considerations, such as bias and fairness.","['ai', 'politics', 'governance', 'public policy', 'surveill011', 'defense', 'online information', 'political campaigns']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
84652,Representation and Voting Rights,"What does it mean to be represented in a democracy? Who has a voice, and who is left out? This course explores political representation—both as an ideal and as a lived reality. We'll examine the design of American democratic institutions, the impact of the Voting Rights Act, and the ongoing role of courts in shaping who gets represented. A central theme will be how race and racial attitudes continue to shape political power and outcomes. Along the way, we'll ask hard questions: Does representation translate into policies that reflect public preferences? How fair are the systems we use to draw voting districts? And what are the consequences of unequal representation for the health of American democracy?","['representation', 'voting rights', 'democracy', 'political institutions', 'voting rights act', 'courts', 'race', 'political power', 'policies', 'voting districts']",design & hci,advanced
84653,US-China Strategic Stability,"This course will explore a range of issues that create tension and competition in the US China relationship. As the two countries seek strategic stability and vie to retain or gain advantage in global influence, each country defines its success differently, and in ways that could bring it into conflict with the other. This course will examine key issues in the US-China relationship that create and exacerbate tensions, including Taiwan, cybersecurity, the AI ""race"", nuclear weapons and long range strike, and scientific cooperation, and technology development.","['us-china relationship', 'strategic stability', 'taiwan', 'cybersecurity', 'ai race', 'nuclear weapons', 'long range strike', 'scientific cooperation']",computer science & engineering,advanced

84665,The Politics of Fake News and Misinformation,"In this course, we will examine the drivers and dynamics of misinformation, fake news, and related phenomena in social and political life. From wartime ""atrocity propaganda"" to climate denialism to false claims of election fraud, how can we characterize fake news and misinformation, and why do they often spread so widely? What are the factors that explain why people accept or reject them, and what are their consequences for our political behavior? Finally, how can they be successfully countered and combatted? In this course, we will look at these and other questions, drawing on the fast-growing body of research on the topic from a range of fields including psychology, communications, political science, and computer science. In terms of the course's structure, we will first focus on defining and characterizing fake news and misinformation, and next we will examine their production (why are they created?), consumption (why are they believed?), and consequences (what influence do they have?). Then, we will analyze the threat of misinformation in several important contexts - including COVID-19, climate change, and armed conflict - and finally we will consider research and analysis about how to best counter it. For the final assignment in the course, students will build on what they have learned throughout the semester to write an original research paper applying ideas and arguments from class to a case of fake news or misinformation that is of special interest to them.","['misinformation', 'fake news', 'propaganda', 'social media', 'political behavior', 'research', 'countermeasures', 'covid-', 'climate change', 'armed conflict']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
84666,"The 21st Century Presidency: Expanding Powers, New Challenges","The president is undisputedly at the center of the US government: the most powerful and prominent person in the country (and quite possibly the world), endowed with vast policymaking authority and broad latitude to set the national agenda. When creating the Constitution, however, the Framers devised an institutional arrangement that prioritized Congress and restricted an empowered chief executive with legal and practical constraints to prevent the president from becoming an autocrat. How did we get from there to here, and is the contemporary presidency truly as omnipotent as it appears? This course engages these questions by examining the presidency's place in the broader political system. Specifically, we will explore the president's interactions with the other branches of government, the parties, interest groups, and the public, analyzing the tools available to presidents to achieve their goals as well as the resources other actors possess to influence the chief executive and protect their own prerogatives. We will also investigate the structure and historical development of the executive branch along with the dynamics of presidential elections to assess their impact on the modern presidency. Throughout the semester, the class will incorporate case studies of presidential decision-making in critical moments to understand more fully both these individuals and the office they occupy.","['presidency', 'constitution', 'congress', 'executive branch', 'presidential elections', 'power', 'influence', 'parties', 'interest groups']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
84668,Technology Ethics,"Churchill once complained that war, once ""cruel and magnificent,"" had been ""completely spoiled"" due to the involvement of scientists in creating new military weaponry. Scientific-military collaborations are hardly new, however. This course provides an introduction to the politics of technology ethics. The purpose of this course is not to instruct on what is or should be considered ethical. Rather, our aim will be to understand how ethical standpoints intersect with the political realm, creating tradeoffs for individuals and societies. Delving into historical technological controversies, we will debate current issues like the precautionary principle, technology neutrality, and individual responsibility.","['technology ethics', 'scientific-military collaboration', 'politics of ethics', 'ethical standpoints', 'tradeoffs', 'individual resp0ltibility', 'precautionary principle', 'technology neutrality', 'historical controversies', 'ethical']",public policy & social sciences,advanced

This course examines how space-based services provide critical support to military and intelligence operations and contribute to national security more broadly. The course is designed to investigate several interrelated themes, weaving together relevant aspects of technology, strategy, and policy. The material is approached from both functional and historical perspectives, beginning with the basics of military and intelligence space operations and ending with an examination of the space- and cyber-related technical, strategic, and political challenges facing the nation today and in the foreseeable future.","['space systems', 'military operations', 'intelligence operations', 'national security', 'technology', 'strategy', 'policy', 'functional perspective', 'historical perspective', 'technical challenges']",business & management,advanced
84683,National Cyber Policy & Strategy,"The decisions nations make in cyberspace have profound implications for both prosperity and sovereignty. The internet is a digital thread tying together peoples. The nature of our participation in this ecosystem is determined by policy makers. Cyber policy mirrors the political ethos of governments. Some nations choose to use cyber as a tool of control and repression, others construct cyber policies as key enablers of innovation and the free exchange of ideas. The translation of traditional policy objectives into a direction for cyber is often problematic. The perpetually liminal state of conflict in cyberspace adds another set of challenges for policy makers. In this course we will explore national cyber policies. We will compare approaches and explore the role of culture. In our analysis we will enumerate the attributes of effective national cyber policy and conduct postmortems on failed policies. We will examine the ethical questions faced by cyber policy makers. Every citizen has a role in cyber policy. This course is intended to prepare future policy makers and create informed citizens.","['cyber policy', 'national strategy', 'internet governance', 'innovation', 'ethics', 'cybersecurity', 'conflict', 'culture', 'postmortem']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
84687,Remote Systems and the Cyber Domain in Conflict,"For most of human history, warfare took place face-to-face or in close proximity using weapons like rocks, swords, spears, bow and arrows, and firearms. The development of technologies like missiles, drones, & the internet have changed the character of warfare by enabling actors to use lethal force & cause disruption thousands of miles away from the battlefield. Technological advancements have arguably even led to the creation of an entirely human-made domain of warfare- the cyber domain- that is distinct from the land, sea, air & space domains. This course will analyze the impact of drones & the cyber domain on international conflict. We will study the historical origins of these technologies, why & how they have spread, their use & effectiveness on the battlefield, ethical questions surrounding their use, & whether arms control is possible. How is the information revolution in computing similar & different from prior revolutions in military affairs? Are drones and the cyber domain transforming conflict by giving the offense a significant advantage over the defense, or is their offensive and destructive potential exaggerated? Is coercion possible in cyberspace, or does the attribution problem impede deterrence? Might drones actually reduce the risks of escalation in interstate conflict by removing the desire for revenge if a pilot is killed? How has the internet been weaponized to enable economic warfare and election interference? Might cyber espionage undermine the United States' military advantage, and should the US ban TikTok? Do drones decrease or increase terrorism? Is remote warfare & the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems- sometimes referred to as killer robots- inherently unethical? These are just a handful of the questions we will explore in this class. By the end of the course, students will have a grasp of the history of the information revolution & many of the key debates & theories in this field.","['remote warfare', 'cyber domain', 'drones', 'international conflict', 'information revolution', 'ethical questions', 'arms control', 'military affairs', 'election interference', 'terrorism']",computer science & engineering,advanced
84689,Terrorism and Insurgency,"This course provides an introduction to terrorism, insurgency, and civil war, covering the causes, dynamics, consequences, and policy responses to these forms of political violence. Insurgent and terrorist groups are some of the most important actors behind security challenges across the world. Definition of these phenomena can be as contentious as the question of which policies are most appropriate to prevent, manage, and resolve the conflicts in which they take part. The course will cover the historical evolution of these forms of violence as well as recent trends. The course will also focus on groups, methods, ideologies, and organizational structures, and will address the effectiveness of different policies over time at preventing and managing these forms of violence, and the role that these policies play in overall national strategy.","['terrorism', 'insurgency', 'civil war', 'political violence', 'security challenges', 'policy responses', 'conflict management', 'ideologies', 'organizational structures']",business & management,advanced
84690,"Social Media, Technology, and Conflict","This course will examine the role that social media and technology have had on conflict at multiple levels, both between and within nations. Interconnectedness has expanded dramatically and continues to expand, allowing the formerly disconnected¿individuals with shared political views, states and diaspora populations¿to be intimately connected. The Arab Spring uprisings were significantly influenced by the use of cell phones, social media, and text-messaging as organizing tools. Insurgent groups like the Islamic States harnessed the power of social media and emerging technologies, and now extremist groups in the US and Europe are using Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and other social media platforms to their advantage. Information war is a critical factor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as both sides work to support/exploit kinetic warfare. Social media is used both to recruit for and fund violent extremism, while the internet has become a channel for radicalizing individuals into violent ideologies. Loss of trust in media and institutions, and the proliferation of mis/disinformation, conspiracy theories, and malign information operations over social media has introduced a new dimensions to conflict and relations between individuals, small groups, non-state actors, and nation-states.","['social media', 'technology', 'conflict', 'insurgent groups', 'extremist groups', 'information war', 'recruitment', 'radicalization', 'misinformation']",business & management,advanced

18742,Computer Architecture and Systems,"Historically, the performance and efficiency of computers has scaled favorably (according to ""Moore's Law"") with improvements at the transistor level that followed a steady trend (so-called ""Dennard scaling""). Unfortunately, device scaling has hit a limit on performance and power improvements dictated by physical device properties. To continue to make systems capable, fast, energy efficient, programmable, and reliable in this ""post-Dennard"" era, computer architects must be creative and innovate across the layers of the system stack. This course begins with a recap of conventional, sequential computer architecture concepts. We will then discuss the end of convention, brought about by the end of Dennard Scaling and Moore's Law, and several trends that these changes precipitated. The first trend is the wholesale shift to parallel computer architectures and systems, covering parallel hardware and software execution models, cache coherence, memory consistency, synchronization, transactional memory, and architecture support for programming, debugging, and failure avoidance. The second trend is the shift to incorporating specialized, heterogeneous components into parallel computer architectures. Topics will include reconfigurable architectures, FPGAs in the datacenter, ASIC accelerators, GPGPU architectures, and the changes to the system stack that these components demand. The third trend is the emergence of newly capable hardware and software systems and new models of computation.

73102,Principles of Microeconomics,"The course is an introduction to microeconomic principles and how to think like an economist. Market and policy outcomes are largely a function of individual decisions. These questions typically take the form: how much and what combination of things should I buy? When do we want businesses to go bust? Should the government fund student tuition? It's my hope that you'll also start to think about everyday questions from an economic lens: why were bicycles so hard to find this past summer? Is Uber surge pricing just a rip-off? Is illegal streaming bad for consumers? Throughout the semester, we will build a toolkit to allow us to understand how these decisions interact and explain market successes, market failures, and the role of government in the marketplace. Toward the end of the semester, we'll change a few underlying assumptions and address a variety of questions related to strategic interaction. Some of the topics we will begin to introduce include credible threats, commitment problems, and the strategic use of information.","['microeconomics', 'individual decisions', 'market outcomes', 'business failures', 'bicycles', 'market successes']",economics,intro

As CMU develops its own blockchain and token---CMU Coin---a central concern is to determine the set of applications that such technology would be most useful for. This course is designed for students to propose and, potentially, develop applications or use cases for a campus blockchain. http://tinyurl.com/cmucoincourse The course begins with a brief introduction to blockchain using Bitcoin as an example of a blockchain protocol. We will examine the market failure Bitcoin was intended to resolve as well as the role of cryptography and distributed systems in enabling this new technology to create societal value. The course will go on to discuss the boundaries of the role of cryptography in blockchain. Next, we will use these tools to evaluate existing, real-world blockchain use cases with an eye towards developing our own applications of these emerging technologies. Along the way, we will learn practical development skills in distributed ledger technologies to understand blockchain programming and application development. Finally, students will propose their own blockchain use cases for CMU's own proprietary blockchain.

The course will begin with an overview of the ways groups of individuals organize for collective action by examining different types of political institutions, the role these institutions play in different contexts, and the economic and strategic micro-foundations that give rise to these institutions. We will then examine the empirical evidence supporting this taxonomy, leading to a more detailed consideration of institutions that moderate social conflicts. The next part of the course examines basic results in social choice theory: the Condorcet paradox, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, majority rule, median voter theories, and modern treatments of probabilistic voting models that allow for strategic behavior, misrepresentation of preferences, and policy manipulation. From this basis for understanding collective choice mechanisms, we will then examine how institutions foster cooperation, looking in detail at problems of public goods allocation, redistribution of income, the organization of clubs - interest groups and lobbying associations --in the private sector, and the organization of legislative activities in the public sector. In our examination of voting and electoral mechanisms, we will look at practical applications of the theory to problems of gerrymandering, voter suppression, and propaganda that feature prominently in contemporary political discourse.","['political economy', 'collective action', 'political institutions', 'social choice theory', 'public goods', 'redistribution', 'clubs', 'legislative activities', 'voting mechanisms']",economics,intermediate

We will discuss the economic function of contracts and, when contracts fail or are not feasible, the role of legal remedies to resolve disputes. We will also discuss at some length the choice between encouraging private parties to initiate legal actions to correct externalities and governmental actors, such aas regulatory authorities. Extensive attention will be given to the economics of litigation, and to how private incentives to bring lawsuits differ from the social value of litigation. The economic motive to commit crimes, and the optimal governmental response to crime, will be studied in depth. Specific topics within the preceding broad themes include: the Coase Theorem; the tradeoff between the certainty and severity of punishment; the choice between ex ante and ex post sanctions; negligence versus strict liability; property rules; remedies for breach of contract; and the American rule versus the English rule for allocating litigation costs.","['law and economics', 'market failures', 'legal remedies', 'contracts', 'externalities', 'litigation economics', 'coase theorem', 'punishment tradeoff', 'sanctions', 'negligence']",economics,intermediate

Experiences in the course give students the opportunity to draw on multiple cultural and linguistic understandings and practices when analyzing and creating meaningful texts. The course emphasizes critical reading and research strategies for a variety of sources which become the basis for individually and collaborativelyproduced texts. The course introduces students to rhetorical choices within and across languages at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels. Students will explore a variety of practices in academic writing (e.g., paraphrase, synthesis, counterargument and refutation, citation) as they relate to genre, audience, purpose, and other factors of a communicative situation. We discuss and practice explicit rhetorical and linguistic conventions for writing in academic English so that writers make choices to connect with readers in academic and professional discourse communities. Students who take this course identify as multilingual students who use English skillfully but perhaps with less comfort as they use another language. These students complete an online placement process that guides them through making their own informed course placement. Students may also skip the placement process and enroll directly into the course. For some students, 76100 is a prerequisite requirement for other first-year writing courses; therefore, students should check with their academic advisors regarding how 76100 fulfills their general education course requirements.

Within the course, students learn genre-based skills applicable to a variety of different fields. Students use a comparative genre analysis method to learn how to use models to take on new writing tasks, including an academic research proposal and a research article that contributes to an ongoing academic conversation. Faculty who teach 76101 typically select textsranging from scholarly texts, journalism, and filmabout an issue so that students can identify interesting questions for their own research projects. Students should expect explicit, research-based instruction, practice, and reflection to build knowledge in controlling their writing processes and writing clear, well-supported, reader-oriented arguments. Because the course emphasizes the real stakes of communicating with readers and listeners, students share with their peers both low and high stakes written work within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment.

Within the course, we will discuss texts and evidence from multiple perspectives. We will examine how literary and cultural scholars write about texts (defined broadly), how they make claims, provide reasoning, and use textual support to argue for particular ways of seeing cultural objects. Throughout the semester, students will draw upon prior strategies and develop new ones for close reading and for critical analysis in order to produce their own thesis-driven arguments about why texts matter.

This course (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement) focuses upon interpreting and making arguments using mainly numerical data but also qualitative data. We will look at research in a range of disciplines including psychology, education, medicine, engineering, and the sciencesand note how writers select and analyze the data they collect. We will also examine what happens to this research when it is picked up by the popular media. Students will also practice collecting and analyzing their own data and reporting it to suit the needs of various stakeholders. There are two primary audiences for this section. Students in data-driven majors will find the section useful preparation for communicating in their disciplines. Students in other fields will learn how to critique and respond to the many ways that numbers shape our lives. This section presumes a basic ability to calculate averages, percentages, and ratios, but no advanced mathematical or statistical preparation. Instead, this section provides a fascinating look at how numbers and words intersect to create persuasive arguments in academic, professional, and popular contexts. Students will compare and analyze texts that make arguments with data, practice rhetorical strategies for synthesizing and representing data so that by the end of the class, students will apply these strategies to write an original data-driven research proposal.","['data', 'research', 'arguments', 'statistics', 'psychology', 'education', 'medicine', 'sciences']",english,intro

In this 76101 class (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement), we will learn how public problems are defined and argued across a range of texts, including proposals, op-ed genres, and white papers. By analyzing a range of proposal texts, we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal, arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values. We will learn strategies for evaluating and synthesizing data from existing research to use in a proposal argument. By the end of the course, students will write their own proposal that recommends a solution and a feasible plan for solving a real problem.","['solutionpublic problems', 'investigation', 'research', 'proposals', 'op-ed', 'white papers', 'rhetoric', 'evidence', 'argumentation', 'data synthesis']",english,intro

Spring 2026: Law & Literature - This course offers a real-time understanding of significant legal issues that undergraduates, including those who might be considering careers in law, need to know about. Even those not specifically interested in law will benefit from the medium we use, which is that of imaginative fiction. Scenes from stories (and some films and popular culture media) that deal with law provoke our discussions, including well known trial scenes (MERCHANT OF VENICE [Shakespeare], BILLY BUDD SAILOR [Melville]), portraits of men and women in the profession of law (GREAT EXPECTATIONS [Dickens], THE FALL [Camus], ""A Jury of Her Peers"" [Glaspell]; and narratives that show how the rhetoric of law sometimes fails to grasp the problems of less powerful communities (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD [Lee]; THE FIXER [Malamud]. Students will want to read these and other stories, and to screen films and TV shows about law, with some care, so the course always links the skill of reading well with the policies of a sound approach to the institutions of power. There is no final exam, but there will be a final paper of the student's choosing as discussed with the instructor, and other shorter responsibilities during the semester. The instructor will work closely on each student's writing skills as the semester proceeds. Richard Weisberg has taught both law and English Literature for many years, has practiced law in New York and in federal court, has been an appointee of Pres.

Indeed, we're interested in books that are so controversial that people will shout, argue, and try to change laws in order to have a book removed from a curriculum, a school or public library, or a prison. At the same time, we'll learn about how, in response, other people work extremely hard to defend books against removal and censorship. The term ""banned books"" can be a bit misleading in the US context; only in very rare cases does the US federal government get involved in trying to ban or censor a published work. Nonetheless, the US is a hot spot for those who seek to attack books, and those who seek to defend them. In this course you will find that the actions of attackers and the actions of defenders are often mutually reinforcing. Every student in this course will contribute to a public facing website called The CMU Banned Books project.

What does it mean now, 55 years later, to be Asian American? How is ""Asian Americanness"" defined through and against dominant racial, social, cultural, and political meanings? How do Asian Americans fit into the differentially racialized landscape of the U.S., and how, in turn, are Asian American identities and experiences shaped and expressed? How does the political and activist history of Asian America inform Asian Americanness, and social movements in general, today? Is the label of ""Asian American"" a drawback or a resource? To grapple with these questions, this course brings together Asian American studies, ethnic studies, and Asian American rhetoric to examine the currents of global and domestic power that have shaped Asian American experience, the movements and communities that have acted in solidarity among and against those forces, and the communicative practices that both shape and are shaped by Asian Americans.","['asian american identity', 'pan-asian solidarity', 'racialization', 'us landscape', 'asian american experience', 'social movements', 'asian american rhetoric', 'global power', 'ethnic studies']",english,intro

76221,Books You Should Have Read By Now: Burnout: Fiction at the Edge of Exhaustion,"Topics vary by semester: S26: Burnout: Fiction at the Edge of Exhaustion - Amidst growing economic inequality, environmental crisis, and the pressures of contemporary work, social life, and digital culture, it is easy to feel that we are living in a world defined by burnout, exhaustion, and disconnection. Contemporary novels grapple with these conditions, exploring characters who navigate precarious jobs, fraught relationships, and the constant tension between desire and obligation. These stories often focus on emotional and psychological states like numbness, boredom, withdrawal, and subtle acts of resistance to capture the lived experience of life under capitalism. By studying these works we can begin to understand how literature transforms the affective conditions of contemporary life into narrative, mood, and theme. But why are stories of disaffection and exhaustion resonating so strongly right now? What can novels reveal about the ways we cope with social pressure, labor, intimacy, and selfhood in a world where emotional life has itself become a form of labor? And do these novels simply reflect society, or do they offer tools for critique and resistance? In this class, we will explore contemporary fiction that examines these questions, focusing on how novels portray emotional states shaped by neoliberal capitalism and how characters negotiate, or resist, the systems that structure their lives. Through close reading and discussion, we will consider the ways literature allows us both to recognize and critique the social, economic, and technological forces that shape our inner lives. Readings will include Severance by Ling Ma, My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh, The Circle by Dave Eggers, Acts of Desperation by Megan Nolan, and excerpts from New York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson. Assignments in this class will include discussion board responses, a short midterm essay, and a final research paper.","['solutionburnout', 'fiction', 'contemporary novels', 'emotional states', 'capitalism', 'social pressure', 'labor', 'intimacy', 'selfhood', 'critique']",english,intro

The course features an intersectional approach to consider how diverse identities and experiences have shaped discussions of feminism, masculinity, gender construction, sexualities, and body politics. While focused primarily on a various American context, the course extends to the global. We will examine the present and future of a world shaped by gender norms, representations and identities and consider some of the most urgent questions of our own moment.

76247,Shakespeare: Comedies and Romances,"Sometime around the late sixteenth century, enterprising cultural producers in early modern London began to develop a new commercial venture called 'playing': a business that offered ordinary people a few hours of dramatic entertainment for the price of one penny. In addition to watching the professional players onstage, spectators also participated in a form of play themselves, in a sense, because theatrical experience provided a unique opportunity to engage imaginatively with otherwise inaccessible people, worlds, and ideas. More than four hundred years later, the drama of the period now ranks among the most esteemed texts in all English literature, and the name 'Shakespeare' has become a byword for literary genius. This course will offer a selection of Shakespeare's delightful and sometimes surprisingly edgy comedies and late romances. As we read through these works, we will endeavor to understand what, and how, they meant in their original context, thereby developing a historically informed perspective on their influence over our own cultural landscape.","['shakespeare', 'comedies', 'romances', 'early modern london', 'dramatic entertainment', 'cultural producers', 'imaginative engagement', 'english literature', 'historical context', 'influence solutionshakespeare']",english,intro

76259,Film History,"This introductory course will focus on the history of the American film industry, 1930-1950. Every week, we will screen a film of the most important genres and we will understand these films in relation to multiple contexts: the system of production, popular, critical, and scholarly reception, and social and political events. We will be concerned with understanding how the studio system produced and marketed these works, and how that system changed significantly as result of various events post-WW II. The class will also examine how particular companies produced films of a certain type in terms of such parameters as genre, theme, player, class address, and/or style. Readings will deal with the history of Hollywood, the social and political history of the period, and documents concerning the various films. Students will learn important skills for film history, including reception study, archival research, and contextual analysis. Grades will be based on three papers that require different kinds of historical research, a midterm, and a final.","['film history', 'american film industry', '1930-1950', 'film genres', 'production system', 'critical reception', 'scholarly reception', 'archival research', 'contextual analysis']",english,intro

76261,Intro to Writing Creative Nonfiction,"According to The National Endowment for the Arts, creative nonfiction is ""factual prose that is also literary."" Memoir, the essay, and literary journalism are just three kinds of work that fit into this broad, vital genre. While creative nonfiction often borrows techniques from fiction, such as narrative, scene, dialogue, and point of view, creative nonfiction is based on actual events, characters and places. What distinguishes creative nonfiction from journalism is that it conveys more than bare-bones facts: language, analysis and narrative voice are an integral part of each piece. Journalists seek the truth by attempting to be objective. Writers of creative nonfiction understand that truth is often the biased, subjective ""truth"" as experienced by the author.","['creative nonfiction', 'memoir', 'essay', 'literary journalism', 'narrative', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'point of view', 'truth']",english,intro
76264,Special Topics in Writing & Communication: AI & Writing: Foundations and strategies for effective writing with AI tools,"Topics vary by semester. Spring 2026: This micro-course explores the question ""can AI tools support the writing (and 'learning to write') process without replacing student learning?"" and equips the learner to think critically and pragmatically about the integration of AI tools into the writing and learning process. In this course, students can expect to analyze use cases, read and conduct research, and engage in discussions of the use of AI across diverse communicative contexts while themselves experimenting and engaging with a range of tools, concepts and approaches to writing and learning with AI. Throughout this six week course, students will gain experience with library research and case study analysis, rhetorical reasoning, audience-centered and reflective writing and argumentation writing through a variety of genres that may include analyses and report, proposals, and oral presentations alongside shorter, low-stakes assignments like discussion posts, reflections, learning logs, quizzes and more. This course is designed to be an exploratory and reflective workshop-based learning experience where students examine their own writing processes and goals alongside the communicative expectations of their future workplace contexts. As such, and given the ever evolving nature of AI affordances and challenges, this course is a good fit for students that are highly self-directed, motivated, flexible, and curious about emerging trends and best practices at the intersection of AI, education, and responsible, effective communication. This course runs January 5, 2026 through February 4, 2026.","['ai', 'communication', 'research', 'ai tools', 'writing process', 'writing strategies']",english,intro

76269,Introduction to Screenwriting,"This is a course in screenplay narrative. The screenplay has a certain format observed by every screenwriter. Everything in it-- the title of the scene, the description, of the action, the dialogue -- has its designated place. Though there have been certain changes in formatting over the years, for instance scenes used to be numbered, writers used to include camera angles, the basic structure has not changed. It is not so difficult to learn the format. The difficulty is in developing a screen story populated by believable characters, creating an expressive and logical relationship between the scenes by manipulating screen space and screen time, knowing what to omit from the story and what to emphasize, and finally writing dialogue that sounds real, but that does not simply copy everyday speech. These are our goals for the semester.","['screenplay format', 'screenplay narrative', 'screen space', 'screen time', 'believable characters', 'expressive relationship', 'scenes', 'dialogue']",english,intro

76278,Japanese Film and Literature: The Art of Storytelling,"This course explores how the art of storytelling is in tandem with the vicissitudes of the human condition as illustrated in Japan's variety of fictions, non-fictions, and films in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Analyses of each storytelling not only reveal the cultural dynamics behind Japanese modernity, but also invite students to find new insights into Japanese culture and their ways of perceiving our globalized world. What kind of cultural exchanges took place between modern Japan and the West? How are Japan's traditional values transformed in the face of modern technicalization and industrialization, compared to the modernization of other countries? And, in turn, what kind of impact has modern Japanese culture had on today's world? Tackling these questions among others, the course also extends to such issues as the legacy of traditional Japanese culture, the modern Emperor system, World War II experiences, emerging voices of minorities, and popular culture (e.g., anime and subculture). This course is taught in English.","['japanese culture', 'modernity', 'cultural exchange', 'globalization', 'traditional values', 'modernization', 'world war ii', 'anime']",english,intro
76289,Billingual & Bicultural Experiences in the US,"What does it mean to be bilingual in the USA, when approximately 80% of Americans are monolingual English-speakers? In this course, we will learn about the nature and experience of bilingualism and biculturalism (past and present) and how it shapes different perspectives and worldviews--within an individual, between individuals, and on a larger (societal, cultural) level. The course highlights the experiences of groups such as immigrants, racial/ethnic minorities, indigenous communities, and users of signed languages to foreground experiences that may be similar to or different from those of the students. We use a variety of resources (e.g., social media, film and documentaries, historical documents, literature, music, art) to accomplish this, and students are encouraged to be creative in the ways they design their own hands-on projects. This discussion-based course is taught in English and is open to all students, whether they identify as bilingual/bicultural, or are simply interested in the course topic.","['bilingualism', 'biculturalism', 'immigrants', 'racialethnic minorities', 'indigenous communities', 'signed languages', 'perspect0ives', 'worldviews', 'societal level', 'cultural level']",english,intro

76296,20th Century Russian Masterpieces,"At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Empire underwent a series of dramatic changes in quick succession: industrial modernization, the unsuccessful 1905 rebellion, terrible losses in the First World War, finally culminating in the 1917 October Revolution. The literature and culture of the era were deeply impacted by these upheavals as artists and writers of the era attempted to capture and convey the world rapidly shifting around them. This course will acquaint students with canonical texts from 20th-century Russian literature and will also examine the highly specific context in which they were produced. From the fin-de-siècle aesthetics of a crumbling Russian Empire to the avant-garde experimentalism of the Russian Revolution and Civil War era, to the establishment of Socialist Realism and the implementation of a Totalitarian regime under Stalin, the course invites students to think about both the realities of life and artistic production in a rapidly transforming country as well as the ways in which these works bring contemporary readers to the inner lives of Soviet citizens.","['russian literature', '20th century', 'russian empire', 'industrial modernization', '1905 rebellion', 'world war i', 'october revolution', 'avant-garde', 'socialist realism', 'stalin']",english,intro
76299,19th Century Russian Masterpieces,"Russian literature of the 19th century was shaped by its engagement with the so-called accursed questions—""accursed"" for being urgent and inescapable but possibly unanswerable. What is the self? What is the meaning of life and of death? What is truth? What is justice? What does it mean to live a righteous life? In Russia these existential quandaries fell within the purview not only of philosophers but also of the poets and prose writers we will consider in this course. While the course roughly follows the chronology of the 19th century, it is structured around these accursed questions rather than by literary movement or genre. There are two reasons for this. First, Russia's literary culture began to develop later than other traditions; as a result, Russian authors of the 19th century were exposed to many different movements and often participated in several at once. Second, and relatedly, many authors worked across genres and in dialogue with philosophers, critics, novelists, and poets. They published in ""thick journals,"" composed of texts ranging from the literary to the journalistic to the academic. For these reasons, it is difficult to categorize these authors along stylistic or generic lines. As philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev observes, what united them was an abiding interest in the most profound existential questions. Students in this course will examine how an author's use of genre, affiliation with particular literary movements, and socio-political commitments inflected their treatment of the accursed questions. Students will become familiar with not only the cultural artifacts of this fertile century but also the circumstances—historical, cultural, institutional—in which these artifacts were created. They will also be encouraged to reflect on how these perennial accursed questions are articulated at present, and what that reveals about our own socio-political commitments and generic loyalties.","['existential questions', 'philosophical engagement', 'literary movements', 'genre', 'socio-political context', 'cultural artifacts', 'accursed questions', 'literary analysis', 'historical context']",english,intro
76301,Internship,"This course is designed to help you explore possible writing-related careers as you gain workplace experience and earn academic credit.

Every picture is comprised of a story, visuals, and, sometimes, sounds. This class is about learning how to understand and control time-based images to better tell your story. We will learn essential skills for becoming a creative technological storyteller - how to think visually and aurally. Fundamental focus will be on understanding the basic visual components -using space, tone, line, shape, color, movement and rhythm- and how they are used to visually tell a story, define characters, communicate moods, emotions, thoughts and ideas. We often are not consciously aware of them within a film but are critical in establishing the relationship between story structure and visual structure. Through readings, film analysis, creative brainstorming, assignments and individual critiques this class will guide each student into translating their creative vision into a short final film.","['film production', 'creative technological storyteller', 'visual components', 'story structure', 'film analysis', 'final film', 'creative vision']",english,intermediate

It's clear that fiction has changed since the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of postmodernism, but it's hard to pin down what characterizes the work that has come since. In this course, we will read a selection of American fiction from the 1980s to the present and try to get a sense of its main lines. In particular we'll look at the turn to ""genre,"" the expansion to multicultural authors, and the return to realism. Also, we will consider how it relates to American society. Authors might include authors like Alison Bechdel, Jennifer Egan, Emily St. John Mandel, Weike Wang, and Colson Whitehead.","['contemporary american fiction', 'postmodernism', 'genre', 'multicultural authors', 'realism', 'american society', 'alison bechdel', 'jennifer egan', 'weike wang']",english,intermediate

Why is Martin Luther King Jr. best remembered for saying, ""I have a dream,"" and not for saying, ""War is the greatest plague that can affect humanity""? What are political ""talking points"" and how are they perpetuated? How does a claim (unfounded or not) become a fact? How does a fact become a myth? These are just some of the questions that we will consider. More specifically, this is a course in how meaning changes as texts created in one context and for specific purposes are repeated, cited, and used in other contexts and for other purposes, sometimes related and relevant, sometimes not. More technically, we'll be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse. Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kindsincluding politicians, journalists, and scientistsstrategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed. Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends. More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable. Ultimately, you can conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals.","['- intertextuality', '- rhetoric', '- language', '- persuasion', '- context', '- discourse', '- voice', '- recontextualization', '- reinterpretation', '- qualifications']",english,intermediate

Our focus will be on practical actions that you can take to improve your school, workplace, or extracurricular groups. Course readings will come from diverse sources and fields, including sociolinguistics, psychology, education, organizational communication, and writing studies.

That toolkit will include methods for the collection of data, its processing via off-the-shelf software and some simple code, as well as its analysis using a variety of statistical techniques. In doing so, the class offers students the opportunity to engage in scientifically oriented inquiry, giving priority to the use of corpus evidence to answer research questions. The first part of the term will be devoted to introducing fundamental concepts and taking a bird's eye view of the potential application of corpus methods in domains like academic writing, technical communication, and social media. From there, students will initiate projects of their own choosing and develop them over the course of the semester. The goal is to acquaint students with the strengths and limitations of computer- based textual analysis and to provide them with the necessary foundational skills to design projects, to apply appropriate quantitative methods, and to report their results clearly and ethically to a variety of audiences. This class requires neither an advanced knowledge of statistics nor any previous coding experience, just a curiosity about language and the ways in which identifying patterns in language can help us solve problems and understand our world.","['corpus linguistics', 'textual analysis', 'computer-based analysis', 'data collection', 'statistical techniques', 'technical communication', 'social media', 'research inquiry', 'methodological toolkit']",english,intermediate

We will read a range of theories, from ancient philosophers like Aristotle, through 18th and 19th century philologists, and the 20th century theory and practice of New Criticism. We will study the hermeneutics of suspicion of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, the structuralism of Levi-Strauss, and the poststructuralism of Barthes, Derrida, and their disciples. We will conclude with some 21st century contributions to these debates.. How have such critics and theorists thought about the meaning and experience of texts?

Investigative journalism uncovers it, digging through public records and data to expose corruption or correct social injustices. The process takes patience and persistence, as well as familiarity with right-to-know laws, to find that gold nugget of information that exposes secrets or becomes the missing piece to a larger puzzle. In this course, students will learn investigative techniques that make the powerful accountable, using government documents, financial filings and databases to spot undetected crime patterns, an unfair housing policy or perhaps questionable spending by a non-profit charity. Investigative journalism has a storied history of exposing wrongdoing and today many of the tools historically used to tell those stories are available to everyone. This course will help budding journalists, researchers and anyone else interested in addressing societal problems find those tools and learn how to use them.

We'll examine how a poem's shape can communicate, how its music can stir, and how the space of its page can speak. Students will read work by contemporary poets and consider what their work teaches us as they write their own poems and respond to the work of their peers. Through readings, discussions, and writing exercises, we'll experiment with different methods of employing the line, the line break, white space, rhythm, breath, music, sound and silence to build the sensory world of a poem.","['poetry', 'form', 'craft', 'emotion', 'shape', 'communication', 'music', 'rhythm', 'white space']",english,intermediate

Essential to the research and development of the class are the concepts of humanity and empathy within socio-technical transformations in the world. Ideas such as: reality ahead of schedule; high tech, low life; neon and corporate dystopias; cyberpunk; post-humanism; sustainability; etc, will be analyzed and discussed. Concepts of civilization, the cityscape, the individual, the body and the mind will be examined as we see technology and society evolve. During the 2026 spring semester we will be focusing on the impact and development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on individuals and society.

While today we might be genuinely concerned about texting while driving, or the depression associated with high levels of facebook use, in this class we won't judge so much as we will analyze. We will look at what historical media trends have in common with, and how they are different from, the media trends of today. We will read about the print revolution, the electronic media revolution, the current digital revolution, and we will also try to peer into the future. Importantly, we will take a literary and cultural studies approach to this material. We will ask, specifically, what can the Humanities teach us about media revolutions over time?

76416,Rhetorics of Race & Empire,"The construction and enforcement of racial hierarchies has been a central phenomenon in empire-building around the world. This class takes as its main focus the relationship between imperialism and race, especially in, but not limited to, the United States. How has the U.S. justified imperial expansion around the world-military, economic, and cultural? How have its actions triggered the movements and migrations of populations, and how have those movements and displacements been explained? What cultural shifts around racial meanings have occurred, here and abroad, as a result of U.S. imperialism? How has the role of the U.S. in relation to the rest of the world, particularly peripheries and the global South, been narrated? We will take a special interest in the role of language in constructing and perpetuating racial meanings in the context of empire, and in the everyday communicative practices that both shape and have been shaped by imperial impulses. Students will learn to think critically about the presence of such discourses in everyday life, and produce a final paper or project analyzing a narrative of their own choosing in which race and empire intersect.","['race', 'empire', 'us', 'imperialism', 'migration', 'cultural shifts', 'language']",english,intermediate

This course studies novels, poetry and prose in relation to both political and industrial revolutions during the rise of empire and capitalism and the road to climate change. We will study apocalyptic novels like Mary Shelley's The Last Man and novels of empire like Jane Eyre and its retelling in Wide Sargasso Sea; poetry about living in revolutionary times by Wordsworth and Phillis Wheatley Peters; and anti-slavery writing such as Ottobah Cugoano's ""Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery.""

76439,Seminar in Film and Media Studies,"Topics vary by semester. Spring 2026: East Asian Film - This course will examine cultural change in East Asia since the end of the Second World War as seen through the prism of film. In a globalized world the standards of cultural exchange have sometimes led to a process of encroachment and the subversion of a native culture. As one of the most visible of cultural products, however, film clearly demonstrates that this is frequently not the case. There is a complex interplay between pressures to globalize and the traditional concerns and norms of societies. An examination of the discourse and rhetoric of filmed texts provides evidence of cultures working to maintain their identity, adapting new modes of expression to their own ends and actively exporting their own cultural ideas through the medium of cinema. To illustrate this point, we will closely examine the cinematic output of a variety of national film industries, including those of Japan, China and Korea from the mid-1940's to the present day. At the conclusion of this course students will have a basic knowledge of film output in the selected regions, be aware of the aesthetic traditions, stylistic tendencies and rhetoric of those films, and have an understanding of issues of cultural exchange as reflected in East Asian film.","['film', 'cultural change', 'east asia', 'globalization', 'cultural exchange', 'cinema', 'aesthetic traditions', 'stylistic tendencies', 'rhetoric', 'cultural identity']",english,intermediate
76453,Literature of Empire: The Imperial Gothic,"This course will investigate gothic literature within the international context of global imperialism. From Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to Marvell's Dr. Strange, Western society has been haunted by its own development. The imperial gothic is a genre associated with fear, dread, horror, romance and haunting; it marks anxieties about the decline of civilization at the very moment of empire's expansion. Scholars have noted the ways late 18th to early 20th century gothic stories reveal cracks within modern ambitions. Contemporary global fiction writers have also turned to the gothic, expanding those fissures in the foundation of empire as a decolonial strategy. This course will investigate literature and a few films within the international context of global imperialism through a focus on the gothic. We will begin with the colonial stories of empire, before turning to their rewriting in contemporary fiction. Possible topics include invention gone wrong, empire's ghosts, the spread of disease, and haunted landscapes.","['gothic literature', 'imperialism', 'global fiction', 'colonial stories', 'empire', 'decolonial strategy', 'invention', 'ghost', 'disease']",english,intermediate

We'll complement our workshops with readings from masters of short fiction and novels, with an eye on sharpening our own facility with dialogue, structure, and voice. Each student must be prepared to constructively critique and deconstruct her/his peers' work, as well as actively contribute to class discussions about the elements of craft that undergird successful works of fiction. Each student will be expected to produce a portfolio of original writing (short exercises originating from thematic prompts and a substantial story) by the end of the semester.","['writing workshop', 'dialogue', 'structure', 'voice', 'critique', 'peer review', 'short exercises']",english,intermediate
76462,Advanced Fiction Workshop,"This is an intensive fiction-writing workshop. You will be required to write three new short stories in the first part of the semester, all of which will be workshopped with discussion primarily on what the story is about and what you want from each piece. You will spend the next part of the course rewriting one of the pieces. Your final portfolio will be comprised of your stories, copies of all your drafts, responses to the books we've read in class, and any other comments, exercise you want to include. I am suggesting you keep a writing notebook - for this class but I will not require it as everyone's writing process is different. One of the great differences between fiction writing at the introductory or intermediate level and fiction at the advanced level is the writer's ability to discuss their own work, and the work of others, in interesting and original ways. Another difference is in the way the writer approaches their own work - establishing a strong narrative voice in each piece as well as acknowledging the relationship between form and content.","['advanced fiction workshop', 'short stories', 'workshop discussion', 'story development', 'portfolio creation', 'writing notebook', 'narrative voice']",english,intermediate

76471,The Pittsburgh Review of Books,"In this course students will learn about editing, publishing, and freelance writing, with an emphasis on work that could be considered the public humanities, that is essays and reviews that serve to make scholarly work accessible to a wider audience. To that end, all students will be working on preparing an essay, review, or interview that could eventually be published in the Pittsburgh Review of Books. Inspired by publications like The Los Angeles Review of Books, The Baffler, N+1, Aeon, and The New Inquiry, the PRB is a Carnegie Mellon based publication featuring cultural and literary criticism, with a focus on issues of technology as they intersect with the humanities.

76487,Information Architecture & Content Strategy,"In the digital age, the vast amount of information available online can be overwhelming, and even individual websites often struggle to present their content in a user-friendly manner. In this course, students will immerse themselves in a semester-long real-world project with practical exercises designed to address this challenge. This course equips students with the skills necessary to develop user-centered information architecture and content strategy/design, enabling them to create user-friendly websites that align with user expectations and industry best practices. Throughout the course, students will adopt a user-centered approach, utilizing essential usability methods to gain insights into the information needs, behaviors, and preferences of users. They will develop the ability to identify and rectify usability issues on websites. Additionally, students will delve into the principles of online information design, encompassing topics such as information architecture, navigation, and effective labeling. In the required lab section of the course, students will gain hands-on experience with core web technologies, including HTML and CSS, to shape and style web content. They will also gain an understanding of JavaScript and APIs, which play a pivotal role in integrating data and services into websites.","['information architecture', 'content strategy', 'user-centered design', 'web content', 'html', 'css', 'javascript', 'apis', 'usability']",english,intermediate

76717,Contemporary American Fiction,"No one seems to know quite how to define contemporary American fiction. It's clear that fiction has changed since the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of postmodernism, but it's hard to pin down what characterizes the work that has come since. In this course, we will read a selection of American fiction from the 1980s to the present and try to get a sense of its main lines. In particular we'll look at the turn to ""genre,"" the expansion to multicultural authors, and the return to realism. Also, we will consider how it relates to American society. Authors might include authors like Alison Bechdel, Jennifer Egan, Emily St. John Mandel, Weike Wang, and Colson Whitehead.","['contemporary american fiction', 'postmodernism', 'genre', 'multicultural authors', 'realism', 'american society', 'alison bechdel', 'jennifer egan', 'weike wang']",english,advanced

Why is Martin Luther King Jr. best remembered for saying, ""I have a dream,"" and not for saying, ""War is the greatest plague that can affect humanity""? What are political ""talking points"" and how are they perpetuated? How does a claim (unfounded or not) become a fact? How does a fact become a myth? These are just some of the questions that we will consider. More specifically, this is a course in how meaning changes as texts created in one context and for specific purposes are repeated, cited, and used in other contexts and for other purposes, sometimes related and relevant, sometimes not. More technically, we'll be focusing on the rhetorical nature of intertextual discourse. Our goal will be to examine the ways that people of all kindsincluding politicians, journalists, and scientistsstrategically draw upon and transform the statements, arguments, and evidence of other people to promote their own viewpoints or purposes. We will begin by investigating scholarship that views language as an extended conversation in which people struggle to have their own voices heard, and other voices countered or even suppressed. Later, we will survey a number of studies that suggest how individuals and organizations recontextualize and reinterpret prior discourse for persuasive ends. More specifically, we will analyze how the micro-features of the language (for example, qualifications, evaluations, and attributions) are used to persuade audiences that certain assertions are (not) factual, that certain speakers are (not) authoritative, and that certain proposed actions are (un)desirable. Ultimately, you can conduct your own research on intertextual rhetoric on a topic of specific interest to your academic or professional goals.","['- intertextuality', '- rhetoric', '- language', '- persuasion', '- context', '- discourse', '- voice', '- recontextualization', '- reinterpretation', '- qualifications']",english,advanced

But communication also offers us a tool for rewriting oppressive social scripts. In this class, we will examine both the inequities embedded in communication practices and strategies for transforming them. Our focus will be on practical actions that you can take to improve your school, workplace, or extracurricular groups. Course readings will come from diverse sources and fields, including sociolinguistics, psychology, education, organizational communication, and writing studies. While our readings might occasionally depress (or enrage) you, the course as a whole will be forward-looking and optimistic, encouraging you to imagine and implement solutions to the problems we explore.","['equity', 'communication', 'power relationships', 'social scripts', 'transformative strategies', 'practical actions', 'school', 'workplace', 'extracurricular groups', 'sociolinguistics']",english,advanced

The process takes patience and persistence, as well as familiarity with right-to-know laws, to find that gold nugget of information that exposes secrets or becomes the missing piece to a larger puzzle. In this course, students will learn investigative techniques that make the powerful accountable, using government documents, financial filings and databases to spot undetected crime patterns, an unfair housing policy or perhaps questionable spending by a non-profit charity. Investigative journalism has a storied history of exposing wrongdoing and today many of the tools historically used to tell those stories are available to everyone.

76780,Methods in Humanities Analytics,"The computer-aided analysis of text has become increasingly important to a variety of fields and the humanities is no exception, whether in the form of corpus linguistics, stylometrics, ""distant reading,"" or the digital humanities. In this course, we will build a methodological toolkit for computer-aided textual analysis. That toolkit will include methods for the collection data, its processing via off-the-shelf software and some simple code, as well as its analysis using a variety of statistical techniques. In doing so, the class offers students in the humanities the opportunity to put their expertise in qualitative analysis into conversation with more quantitative approaches, and those from more technically-oriented fields the opportunity to gain experience with the possibilities and pitfalls of working with language. The first part of the term will be devoted to introducing fundamental concepts and taking a bird's eye view of their potential application in domains like academic writing, technical communication, and social media. From there, students will initiate projects of their own choosing and develop them over the course of the semester. The goal is to acquaint students with the strengths and limitations of computer-aided textual analysis and to provide them with the necessary foundational skills to design projects, to apply appropriate quantitative methods, and to report their results clearly and ethically to a variety of audiences.

How do we assess what our students have learned, and how do we assess the fairness of our methods?We will approach these questions by reading from a variety of disciplines, including writing studies, second language writing studies, educational psychology, and instructional design. First we will conceptualize learners as readers and writers who bring diverse experiences and abilities to the classroom. We will then grapple with the questions about what we should teach our students, or which genres should students learn to write. To clarify the ""what"" question, we will consider frameworks from genre-based pedagogy, corpus-based pedagogy, and anti-racist pedagogy as they apply to teaching First-Year Writing and across disciplines. Finally, we will employ instructional design principles so that students will develop and situate their own pedagogical interventions within an existing curriculum that they have selected. Regular course requirements include brief synthesis papers of the course readings and a final project developed according to students' particular interests.","['writing instruction', 'writing pedagogy', 'writing assessment', 'instructional design', 'genre-based pedagogy', 'corpus-based pedagogy', 'anti-racist pedagogy', 'educational psychology', 'writing studies']",english,advanced

76839,Seminar in Film and Media Studies,"Topics vary by semester. Spring 2026 This course will examine cultural change in East Asia since the end of the Second World War as seen through the prism of film. In a globalized world the standards of cultural exchange have sometimes led to a process of encroachment and the subversion of a native culture. As one of the most visible of cultural products, however, film clearly demonstrates that this is frequently not the case. There is a complex interplay between pressures to globalize and the traditional concerns and norms of societies. An examination of the discourse and rhetoric of filmed texts provides evidence of cultures working to maintain their identity, adapting new modes of expression to their own ends and actively exporting their own cultural ideas through the medium of cinema. To illustrate this point, we will closely examine the cinematic output of a variety of national film industries, including those of Japan, China and Korea from the mid-1940's to the present day. At the conclusion of this course students will have a basic knowledge of film output in the selected regions, be aware of the aesthetic traditions, stylistic tendencies and rhetoric of those films, and have an understanding of issues of cultural exchange as reflected in East Asian film.","['film', 'cultural change', 'east asia', 'post-wwii', 'globalization', 'cultural exchange', 'identity', 'aesthetics', 'stylistic tendencies', 'rhetoric']",english,advanced

94475,Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy,"Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as ""unstructured"". This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. There is a final project in this course which must address a policy question. How this course differs from 95-865 ""Unstructured Data Analysis"": 95-865 emphasizes more of the technical skill development (assessed through two in-class exams involving coding), and does not have any sort of policy focus. 94-775 has a policy-focused final project instead of a final exam. 94-775 does not require cloud computing (part of 95-865 requires the use of Amazon Web Services). Despite these differences, there is heavy material overlap between 94-775 and 95-865.

Historically, marketing decisions were based on intuition, anecdotal information, company capacity and what has worked in the past. John Wanamaker, a successful United States merchant who opened one of the first and most successful department stores in the United States, which grew to 16 stores and eventually became part of Macy's, coined the term - ""Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half"". Dramatic shifts in the marketspace have resulted in changes in consumption, shocks to the supply chain and changes in how organization engage and interact with consumers. In addition, disruption patterns result in fragmentation threatening market share especially for incumbents. Marketing is increasingly being called on to assess organizational strategies to deal with these shifts. With an increasingly digitized society, data has allowed marketers to assess different channels for interaction, monitor the customer journey and measure interaction, brand awareness and consumer sentiment. Marketers are looking to develop individualized consumer experiences which is predicated on data as well as revising processes and interaction across the extended enterprise. Anticipation, resiliency and adaption to these evolving industry dynamics, shocks to the system and changing consumer expectations, is key for staying relevant and being able to take advantages of opportunities as they present themselves. This class is designed to provide students basics of modern marketing but more importantly how they are applied in today's environment.","['marketing', 'digital', 'customer experience', 'engagement', 'data', 'interaction', 'brand awareness', 'consumer sentiment', 'resiliency', 'adaptation']",business & management,advanced

94775,Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy,"Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as ""unstructured"". This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. There is a final project in this course which must address a policy question. How this course differs from 95-865 ""Unstructured Data Analysis"": 95-865 emphasizes more of the technical skill development (assessed through two in-class exams involving coding), and does not have any sort of policy focus. 94-775 has a policy-focused final project instead of a final exam. 94-775 does not require cloud computing (part of 95-865 requires the use of Amazon Web Services). Despite these differences, there is heavy material overlap between 94-775 and 95-865.

The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs. The end goal is a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of the product idea.

5795,Applications of Cognitive Science,"The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally. The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product, a change in practice, or a legal statute. Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting. The questions to be considered include: What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable? What is the pathway from laboratory to practice? What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice? The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students. They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary. The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition. These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.","['cognitive science', 'virtual reality', 'cognitive tutors', 'latent semantic analysis', 'consumer attitudes', 'case studies', 'laboratory to practice', 'barriers', 'discussion']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
5818,Design Educational Games,"The potential of digital games to improve education is enormous. However, it is a significant challenge to create a game that is both fun and educational. In this course, students will learn to meet this challenge by combining processes and principles from game design and instructional design. Students will also learn to evaluate their games for fun, learning, and the integration of the two. They will be guided by the EDGE framework for the analysis and design educational games. The course will involve a significant hands-on portion in which students learn a design process to create educational games, digital or non-digital. They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysis to the class. The intended audience includes graduate and advanced undergraduate students in HCII, CS, ETC, Design, and students interested in education or psychology research. To be eligible to enroll, students must have successfully completed one course in human-computer interaction, game design, computer science, or cognitive/educational psychology, or they must have instructor permission.

5833,"Gadgets, Sensors and Activity Recognition in HCI","Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a user's context and actions. This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations the skills needed to actually build devices. About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area. The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: ""HCI gadgets""). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models. The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student. There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded).

5834,Applied Machine Learning,"Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering.

This course is an introduction to designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces. If you take only one course in Human-Computer Interaction, this is the course for you. This class is a core course for undergrads in the HCI Minor but open to all undergrads and grad students, with either technical or non-technical backgrounds. We will cover theory as well as practical application of ideas from Human-Computer Interaction. Course work includes lectures, class discussion, homework, class presentations, and group project. Students will need a prerequisite of a fundamental computer programming course. Students in the MHCI program are not permitted to take this course.","['human-centered design', 'user interface', 'prototyping', 'evaluation', 'hci', 'theory', 'practical application', 'lectures', 'discussion', 'homework']",design & hci,intermediate
5899,Special Topics in HCI: Design and/of Policy,"The Special Topics in HCI is an opportunity for students interested in HCI to gain a deeper understanding of a specific area in this field. Each class is designed to cover an emerging research area within HCI, from designing large-scale peer learning systems to creating video games around audience agency. All sections will help students: (1) build a more comprehensive understanding of an area of study within HCI, (2) work closely with faculty and peers to create mini-projects or team assignments that help students master the course material, (3) explore evidence-based research methods and techniques in HCI. Sections will vary in topic and often change from semester to semester. Because of this, students can take multiple sections, as they are individual classes. The Undergraduate section is 499 and the graduate section is 899.

79104,Global Histories,"Human activity transcends political, geographical, and cultural boundaries. From wars to social movements, technological innovations to environmental changes, our world has long been an interconnected one. Acquiring the ability to understand such transnational and even worldwide processes is an indispensable part of any college education. This course provides students with an opportunity to develop the skills and perspectives needed to understand the contemporary world through investigating its global history. All sections are comparable in their composition of lectures and recitations, required amounts of reading, and emphasis on written assignments as the central medium of assessment. The sections all aim to help students: (1) master knowledge through interaction with the instructors, reading material, and other students, (2) think critically about the context and purpose of any given information, (3) craft effective verbal and written arguments by combining evidence, logic, and creativity, and (4) appreciate the relevance of the past in the present and future.

79112,Introduction to Asian American History,"This introductory course surveys the histories of Asian Americans from the early nineteenth century to the present. We will cover major themes such as migration and diaspora, race, labor, citizenship, and identity and community formation as we examine the continuities and discontinuities between the Asian American past and present. Special attention will also be paid to both local and global aspects of Asian American history (in the United States, in other countries of the Americas, and in Asia) as we work to build a more robust understanding of what it means to be ""Asian American"" and how such social categorizations fit into broader patterns of construction and re-articulation according to varying historical contexts.

79116,Introduction to the Modern Middle East,"Where is the Middle East, and how have its boundaries been defined and reimagined? What do we really know about a place that has long been a center of creativity, scholarship, and cultural exchange? How have diverse communities across the Middle East engaged with questions of identity, modernity, and tradition? This introductory course examines the history of the region we now call the Middle East by engaging with questions often posed by students encountering it from different perspectives. Rather than treating history as a distant sequence of events, we will explore how people and ideas have moved across national and regional boundaries over time. We will also critically examine the very concept of the ""Middle East,"" considering how colonial histories and geopolitical interests have shaped its meaning and borders. Covering a geographic area that stretches from North Africa to Afghanistan, this course highlights the diversity of political, social, and economic life in the modern Middle East through case studies. Themes such as colonialism, imperialism, decolonization, independence, mass migration, gender, genocide, revolution, and resistance will allow us to connect the region's history to contemporary global issues, including those that shape life in the United States and beyond. As a history course, we will engage with a range of primary sources—including memoirs, music, poetry, literature, and film—to deepen our understanding of the region's past and present. This course is open to all students, whether they have some knowledge of the region or are encountering it for the first time.

79121,Introduction to Islam,"This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to Islam from the advent of the religion in the seventh century to the present day. We will explore the various interpretations and the diverse expressions of Islamic belief and practice around the world in history and today by engaging with both primary sources, such as the Quran, and secondary materials from various perspectives and disciplines, including history, religious studies, political science, law, and sociology, to inform a fuller understanding of this complex and rich religious tradition.

79124,History of Indian Yoga and Meditation,"Yoga and meditation have gained popularity in Western countries as methods for stress relief, enhancing flexibility, physical strength, and mental well-being. But what are the original contexts and theoretical foundations of these practices? How did they evolve over time across different regions in Asia, and how were they influenced by encounters with modernity? This course delves into these questions, examining the underlying doctrines of yoga and meditation, pivotal texts, influential teachers, and the historical development of these practices. Using classical Indian religious and philosophical texts in translation, secondary studies, testimonials, and films, this course provides a foundational understanding of yoga and meditation's journey from their origins to their current manifestations.","['yoga', 'meditation', 'stress relief', 'flexibility', 'physical strength', 'origins', 'evolution', 'asia', 'modernity']",history,intro
79150,"Medieval Science, Magic, and Wonders of Nature","Why do monsters exist and lurk on the margins of our maps? What do animals symbolize--are they God's creations or merely arrangements of the elements? What is the meaning behind a comet--it is natural, a miracle, or something far more sinister? Contrary to popular belief, people in the Middle Ages asked themselves questions about the world around them and sought definitive answers. This course explores the shifting boundaries between science, magic, and religion as defined by thinkers residing in medieval Europe and the Mediterranean between 900 and 1500 C.E. Their observations--and sometimes, experimentations--laid the foundation for the philosophy of nature, which in turn became science as we know it today. In particular, we will address the medieval universe and its cosmology; the physical world and the supernatural; the rationale behind transmutations in alchemy and shapeshifting; the invisible and sacred forces in the heavens and from planetary bodies; contemporary attitudes towards medicine and the human body; and the cross-cultural exchange of knowledge within Christian, Islamic, and Jewish circles of scholarship. As a final project, students will research their own medieval artifact that will be showcased as part of the class's digital ""cabinet"" of collected curiosities and, ultimately, wonder. This course is open to all students, requires no prerequisites, and may be used to fulfill one of the elective requirements for the Religious Studies and/or Science, Technology & Society minors.","['medieval', 'science', 'magic', 'nature', 'cosmology', 'alchemy', 'invisible forces', 'medicine', 'human body']",history,intro
79156,Introduction to Indian History:  From the Mughals to Modi,"This class covers the roughly 500-year period that constitutes ""modern India"" from the establishment of the Mughal Empire in the subcontinent to the ascent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. This course will trace the rule of the Mughals, the arrival of Europeans, the British East India Company and the British Raj, the Indian nationalist movement, and focus extensively on post-independence Indian history (often ignored or short-changed in Indian surveys). In addition to providing a chronological narrative of the recent Indian past, this class will analyze the use and interpretation of history within post-independence and contemporary political debates between the Indian National Congress and Hindu nationalists along with the intersections of history and intellectual and pop culture.","['mughal empire', 'british raj', 'indian nationalist movement', 'narendra modi', 'bjp', 'indian history', 'post-independence', 'political debates']",history,intro
79160,Introduction to the History of Science,"This course provides an introduction to the history of modern science in Europe and North America, from the Enlightenment to the mid-twentieth century. Our goal is to understand scientific theories and practices on their own terms and as products of their own contexts, rather than as a progression of developments moving inevitably toward the present. The course seeks to explore both how and why science has become the dominant way of knowing about the natural world, as well as how scientific activity intersects with the history of religion, war, commerce, and the state. The course also introduces students to the history of science as a standalone discipline, and in particular to the similarities and differences with other objects of historical inquiry (art, politics, etc.).

79170,"Introduction to Science, Technology, and Society","Science and technology are among the most powerful transformative forces in today's global society. They shape the way we think about ourselves, the world around us, and even what is possible in the future. This course provides an introduction to Science and Technology Studies, a vibrant interdisciplinary field that examines the ways that science and technology interact with contemporary politics, culture, and society. Using theories and methods from history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, and public policy, we will examine: the nature of scientific and technical knowledge; how facts are produced both inside and outside the laboratory; how politics and societal values impact scientific inquiry and the development of new technologies; whether objectivity is possible; what expertise is and the role that experts play in the world today; how our understanding of science and technology has been enhanced by focusing on issues of race, sex, gender, sexuality, and class; as well as the imperative to make science and technology more equitable and just than they have been in the past. Specific topics covered will include the development of military technologies like radar and the atomic bomb, genetic engineering and cloning, artificial intelligence, social media, transportation infrastructure, racial classification, gender identity, and the Covid-19 pandemic, among others. This course is meant to serve as a foundation for the new Science, Technology, and Society major, but it is open to anyone concerned with the social and political dimensions of science and technology.","['science', 'technology', 'society', 'interdisciplinary', 'knowledge production', 'scientific inquiry', 'technological development', 'social impact', 'equity', 'justice']",history,intro
79171,"Pharaohs and Phoenicians:  Flourishing, Collapse, and Recovery in the Bronze Age","Espionage, international trade, great-power diplomacy, unprecedented wealth, marriage alliances . . . all of these characterized the Bronze Age Mediterranean world, until it all came crumbling down. The Bronze Age Mediterranean was a peak of ancient civilization that collapsed almost completely after a stunning, and sometimes mysterious, series of crises. History has remembered a ""dark age"" in the wake of this collapse, yet newer evidence reinforces the pockets of resilience shining through the aftermath, and developments from this time are still visible within global society to this day. This course will introduce students to the major Bronze Age and early Iron Age Mediterranean civilizations and their interactions with one another. These will include the Egyptians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Phoenicians, and some of the smaller groups in the Levant. Students will gain an understanding of the factors that allowed these civilizations to flourish, the factors that led to their collapse, and the factors that helped some to rebuild and even thrive once more. We will cover various cultural aspects and examine the evidence—archaeological, documentary, linguistic, etc.—by which historians have reconstructed our understanding of this period.","['bronze age', 'mediterrane0an civilizations', 'egyptians', 'minoans', 'mycenaeans', 'hittites', 'assyrians', 'babylonians', 'phoenicians', 'collapse']",history,intro

This course surveys the development of--and resistance to--such tools by grounding them in the recent cultural history of the United States. Focusing on baseball, medicine, and the law, we'll explore how and why Americans have come to believe mathematical and computational methods can solve complicated problems, even in seemingly unrelated moral, political, and social domains. The course encourages students to think critically about the wider implications of these transformations by situating their development historically.

79200,Introduction to Historical Research & Writing,"Introduction to Historical Research acquaints students with how historians practice their craft in interpreting events from the past. As a class, we will work together through a variety of tools in the historian's toolbox, using episodes from American history as case studies. By the second half of the semester, students will have identified their own topics, in any time period or field of history, and will write research papers incorporating the analytical techniques covered earlier. The goal is for students to learn the skills required to identify a research topic, find and work with many kinds of sources, create a strong thesis statement, design a persuasive paper, and produce a properly formatted and well written research paper.","['historical research', 'interpretation', 'american history', 'research paper', 'analytical techniques', 'thesis statement', 'source analysis']",history,intro
79201,Introduction to Anthropology,"Anthropologist Ruth Benedict claimed that anthropology's mission is truly to ""make the world safe for human difference."" Cultural anthropologists ""make the strange familiar and the familiar strange,"" attempting to understand the internal logic of cultures which might, at first glance, seem bizarre to us. At the same time, anthropologists probe those aspects of our own society which might appear equally bizarre to outsiders. The goal of this course is to raise questions basic to the study of culture and social relationships in a multitude of contexts. We will also discuss the particular research methods informing anthropology, as well as anthropologists' relationship to the people they study, and the responsibilities informing those relationships. The readings focus on topics that have long captured anthropologists' attention and that continue to be intensely debated: social inequality, race, colonialism, body, kinship, religion, gender, social lives of things, globalization and migration. Through written work, including ethnographic readings and a novel, films, and in-class discussions, we will examine how anthropology makes us more aware of our own culturally ingrained assumptions, while broadening our understanding of human experiences. This course is structured as a combination of lectures and seminar discussions. In the first part of the course, I will give a lecture every week, followed by a class session that will focus solely on discussing the readings and key concepts. In the second part of the course, I will introduce the readings by placing them within larger debates, but the course will become more discussion oriented.

79202,"Flesh and Spirit: Early Modern Europe, 1400-1750","This course examines European history from the Black Death to the French Revolution, a period known to history as the ""early modern"" period. That is, it marks a period in European history that was not quite medieval, and yet not quite modern. Many features of modern society, such as the nation-state, free-trade economies, religious pluralism, scientific rationalism, and secular culture trace their origins to the early modern era, yet the period was also marked by important continuities with the Middle Ages. During this course, we will explore how Europeans re-imagined their world in its transition from the medieval to the modern. Topics to be considered will include the ""renaissance"" of the arts, the problems of religious reform, exploration and colonialism, the rise of science, and the expansion of the state. Through these developments, we will focus on Europeans' changing notions of the human body, the body politic, and the natural world, as well as their re-interpretations of the proper relation between the human and the divine, the individual and the community, and the present and the past.","['flesh and spirit', 'early modern europe', 'black death', 'french revolution', 'renaissance', 'arts', 'religious reform', 'exploration', 'colonialism', 'science']",history,intro
79212,Jim Crow America,"Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow (The New Pres 2010) has drawn attention to the ways that American institutions and social systems continue to produce racial inequalities. The recent failure of federal voting rights bills in the United States Congress and the proliferation of state-led efforts to constrain voting rights have led activists to claim ""Jim Crow 2.0."" Using these present-day assessments as a point of departure, this course introduces students to the Jim Crow period of American history spanning the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. From the 1890s to the 1950s, Black freedoms were limited by the policies and practices of racial segregation in the Jim Crow system of American apartheid. This course critically examines Black life in Jim Crow America, from the halls of federal power, to the every-day practices of racial subjugation and resistance. It examines cross-cutting themes: how racial segregation structured the legal, social, economic, and political sectors of American life; the role of national, state, and local policy mandating racial segregation; African American modes of resistance;vigilante and state racial violence. This course will also endeavor to make connections between the consequences of anti-Black racism and the social life of other American minoritized populations. Throughout the course, as an exercise in historical Interpretation and periodization, students will consider the question: Is this current moment ""Jim Crow 2.0.?""

79220,"Screening Mexico: Mexican Cinema, 1898 to Present","This course focuses on Mexican cinema, from its origins in silent film to the present, as a way to explore and consider important issues in Mexican culture, society, and history. Cinema provides a unique window on Mexico's changing social, cultural and political dynamics, past and present, and a context for discussing many topics, such as: indigeneity and the legacies of Spanish colonialism; changing conceptions of Mexican identity; gender and class dynamics and inequalities; political critique and revolutionary movements; and urbanization, migration and ""drug war""-related violence and violence against women in contemporary Mexico. Two particular areas of focus will be films of the Mexican ""Golden Age"" (1930-1960), and ""New Mexican Cinema"" from the 1990s forward.

It explores the ways in which Buddhist institutions, beliefs, practices, and values have responded to dominant Western cultural and intellectual forces within the contexts of colonization and globalization. Focusing on the writings of Western enthusiasts of Buddhism and the reformative projects of Asian Buddhist leaders, this course demonstrates how the forces of modernity have led to distinct developments in the representation, beliefs, and practices of Buddhism. This course is open to all students and majors alike, requires no prerequisites, and may be used to fulfill the Religious Studies minor.","['modernity', 'buddhism', 'colonization', 'globalization', 'western enthusiasts', 'asian leaders', 'reformative projects', 'representation', 'beliefs', 'practices']",history,intro
79230,The Arab-Israeli Conflict and Peace Process Through 1948 to Present,"The course begins with the origins of both Zionism as an intellectual, European movement and of Arab and then Palestinian Arab claims for sovereignty in the early 20th century. The course interrogates not only the histories of ideologies that led to revolution and violence in the modern history of Palestine and Palestinians and of Zionism and Israel, but also the very notions of 'conflict' and 'peace.' It examines ideas of state and nation as well as practices of Ottoman and then British imperialism and Zionist settler colonialism in the territory that became Palestine, then Eretz Israel, and now Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Throughout the semester, students will explore how these ideas and practices are linked to the development of violence, armed struggle and a myriad of nationalist and religious-nationalist ideologies as they came to be understood by Palestinian Arabs, Zionist settlers, Palestinian citizens of Israel, Islamists, and Israeli religious/national groups. Students are tasked with considering the historical social, political, cultural, and religious implications of these discourses and practices. We will make use of documentary and other primary sources and texts, including poems, excerpts from literature, memoirs, film footage, posters, and other forms of media. By the end of the semester, students will be able to analyze and discuss the historical significance of the multi-faceted ideologies and motivations held by actors involved in the armed struggle movement(s) in Palestine and Israel, and the shifting nature of nationalisms as dependent upon locations, time periods, and understandings of history and politics.

This course will look at the history of the Arabian Peninsula from a fresh perspective, examining human/environmental interactions over a long stretch of time. In contrast to the way that Arabian history is typically taught in academia, this course will take the pre-Islamic period of Arabian history (al-jahiliyya) as seriously as the post-Islamic period, and will focus on continuities between the two periods as much as discontinuities. What is more, while conventional histories of the Arabian Peninsula focus on political and religious affairs, this course will try to understand Arabian history on a deeper level by focusing on the lifeways of the Arabian people, including pastoralism, oasis ""bustan garden"" agriculture, fishing and pearling, and shifting patterns of long-distance trade. What is more this course will draw heavily from material from other disciplines, especially medical sciences, to better understand patterns of change over time. Finally, this course will examine to what degree these older patterns of human/landscape interactions are still valid for the Arabian Peninsula today, which has undergone a transformation almost unparalleled in world history due to the discovery natural gas and oil.","['arabian peninsula', 'environmental history', 'pre-islamic period', 'humanenvironment interactions', 'pastoralism', 'oasis agriculture', 'long-distance trade', 'medical sciences']",history,intro

This course investigates these questions across history-from stone tools, agriculture, and ancient cities to windmills, cathedrals, and the printing press; from railroads, electricity, and airplanes to atom bombs, the internet, and the dishwasher. In analyzing these tools, we will explore the dynamic relationships between technological systems and the social, political, religious, artistic, and economic worlds in which they emerged. We will also pay particular attention to technology's effects, asking both who benefited from and who was harmed by technological change. By the end of the course, students will be able to reflect critically on how humanity chooses which technologies to exploit and how human societies have been transformed by these choices.

Were gender relations in postwar Eastern Europe liberated from religious or economic constraints? How did gays and lesbians (and queer and trans persons?) navigate contradictory ideologies of liberation and authoritarianism and heavily regimented social and political environments? Following a loose chronology and analyzing the role of modernization, industrialization, war and other conflicts, the course examines the role and shaping of gender and sexuality in 20th century Eastern Europe. Class materials introduce students to the origin of emancipatory and liberatory ideologies and relevant social movements in 19th century Europe; campaigns promising gender relations based on equality in the newly created Soviet Union and in the so-called Eastern European people's democracies post-World War II; and the legacies of progressive gender politics after the end of the Cold War. Students will place these dynamics within the context of larger historical trends, scrutinizing, for instance, 1960s protest movements that challenged socialist governments and called for liberation in new ways, or policy and cultural shifts resulting from the downfall of Communism in the late 1980s. The course is open to everyone and has no prerequisites.","['gender relations', 'womens emancipation', 'eastern europe', 'gender politics', 'social movements', '20th century', 'soviet union', 'post-world war ii', 'cold war', 'gender equality']",history,intro

The course focuses on cultural history instead of the more traditional emphasis on presidents, wars, and memorizing facts or timelines. The major theme of the course is the changing meaning of freedom over three centuries. Required readings include several short books and historical documents, which will be paired with class lectures to provide students with context needed to think about and understand America's cultural history. Assignments will include three short essays and a final research project on a form of popular culture of the student's choosing, developed over the course of the semester through three short blog posts.","['american history', 'cultural history', 'changing freedom', 'introductory survey', 'class lectures', 'short essays', 'final research project', 'popular culture', 'students choice']",history,intro
79241,The Holocaust:  What You Should Know and Why,"The Holocaust is regularly used to identify 'absolute evil'—comparing military interventions, policies, or extreme uses of violence against civilians to the Nazi genocide serves as a form of condemnation and a call for intervention. Films, books, comics, and songs draw on implicit or explicit references to the Holocaust. At the same time, an increasing number of studies in the USA and elsewhere show that fewer and fewer people are familiar with the history of the Holocaust and can name major events or explain the dynamics of the genocide. This course offers a broad and sophisticated introduction to the history and legacies of the Holocaust and invites students to critically reflect on the genocide's significance for current societies. Among others, course materials analyze how the Holocaust has become a prime example of mass and state violence and served to establish international tools that are designed to protect refugees and civilians threatened by war and genocide and other vulnerable groups. Students with and without pre-existing knowledge will benefit from working with primary source material and learning about recent trends in the field of Holocaust Studies.

Through an examination of a wide range of scholarly and popular debates in African American life and history, this course will emphasize transformations in both inter- and intra-race relations; economic mobility as well as economic inequality; and forms of political engagement and grassroots movements for social change. We will explore these developments under the impact of the segregationist regime; the Great Migration; the rise of the urban-industrial working class; increasing residential segregation; growth and expansion of the middle class; and the fluorescence of the Modern Black Liberation Movement. Students will compare the dynamics of the contemporary Black Lives Matter Movement with earlier 20th century grassroots social and political movements in African American and U.S. history. Finally, based upon a mix of primary and secondary sources and lectures, students will write a series of short analytical essays; and establish their own unique interpretation of key issues in Black History.","['reconstruction', 'african american', 'history', 'joe biden', 'kamala harris', 'scholarly debates', 'race relations', 'economic mobility', 'economic inequality', 'political engagement']",history,intro

Why was the war fought? Was the Confederate cause noble? Did the North oppose slavery? What did freedom mean? How does a nation erect racial justice? What does it mean to fly the Confederate flag or confront a Confederate monument today? Tackling these ongoing debates (and more) from the war (1861-65) itself until today, this course grapples with why the war continues to be one of the most defining moments in U.S. history - 150 years later - and what that means for our past and present as a bi-racial democracy.

We will examine numerous cases, from justice as practiced in African villages to the workhouses created by the British Poor Laws to the Gulag labor camp system in the Soviet Union to the rise of the penitentiary in Europe and the United States. We will read about crime and punishment in the United States, looking at various models from the work gang to solitary confinement. We end by examining the era of mass incarceration to understand how it became a solution to larger problems in American society. The course will be taught as part of the CMU Prison Education project and will take place inside Somerset State Correctional Institution. This course meets the Dietrich Gen Ed ""Perspectives on Justice and Injustice"" requirement. CMU students will learn alongside incarcerated students. All receive full credit for the course. This course meets the Dietrich Gen Ed ""Perspectives on Justice and Injustice"" requirement. We travel on the bus to and from Somerset prison. The bus leaves CMU on Fridays at 12:30 and returns at 6:45. Class time inside the prison runs from 2:30-5:10. An application for admission to the course is required.

79256,Dissecting Modern Masculinities,"Masculinity is a concept that we often think of as static, permanent and natural. This course argues that it is, in fact, socially constructed and historically dynamic: what any society thinks of as normal male behavior is always liable to change. More than that, ideals of manliness are often bound up with questions of race, class and power. Thus, this course looks at the different ideas of masculinity that existed in the ancient world and in the Middle Ages but with most of its focus on the ideals of male behavior at the heart of a number of modernist political projects. The intersections of race and masculinity and changing attitudes toward homosexuality are also studied. This broad range is intended to give students a solid grounding in the academic study of masculinity as well as an understanding of how easily masculinity can change and how regularly it acts as a vehicle for other political concerns. Students are not expected to already have a background in gender theory or the study of masculinity. In addition to its focus on a conceptual problem (how and why normative ideals of masculinity can change) this course seeks to provide students with an opportunity to improve their interpretative and research techniques as well as their expressive and rhetorical skills.","['masculinity', 'social construct', 'historical dynamics', 'race', 'power', 'modernist projects', 'intersectionality', 'homosexuality', 'gender theory']",history,intro
79262,Modern China: From the Birth of Mao ... to Now,"This course is an introduction to major themes in twentieth-century Chinese history, including the transition from empire to nation, revolution, social change and modernization, western imperialism, Chinese colonialism, the rise of the party-state, Chinese socialism and mass movements, economic liberalization, and more. Throughout, we examine the transformation of gender, ethnic, and class relations that occurred across the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. The first half of the class is devoted to the period (1911-1949) between the fall of the imperial system and the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC). If the victory of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and development of the socialist state are to be considered in historical context, it is necessary to first understand the political, cultural, economic, and intellectual currents that preceded them. During the second half of the course, we will examine the CCP as both a state-building institution and an engine of social transformation and look at the tensions these dual roles produced for the state and society. Finally, we will touch upon the Reform Period (1978-2008) and reflect on a newly robust China's attempts—during the self-declared ""New Era"" of Xi Jinping—to come to terms with its own recent past and what the consequences might be for both China and the world. Throughout the course, we rely heavily on primary material in translation to discuss both these issues and the use of sources in the construction of history. From trade disputes, to the Belt and Road Initiative, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang, Covid and the White Paper protests, and more, stories about China appear in the world media on a daily basis. Students are asked to pay attention to these discussions and to think about how they fit into the story of modern China that is unfolding in class.

79266,Russian History and Revolutionary Socialism,"This course covers an epic set of events in Russian history beginning with the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and ending with the death of Stalin in 1953. Spanning almost a century of upheaval and transformation, it examines the terrorist and populist movements against the tsar, the growth of urbanization and a new working class, the great general strike and revolution of 1905, the Russian revolution in 1917, and the Communist Party's attempt to build a new socialist society amid the wreckage of the old. We will discuss the struggle for power within the Party in the 1920s, Stalin's triumph over his opponents, the wrenching processes of collectivization and industrialization, and the ""Great Terror."" The course will explore the Soviet role in World War II, the shattering losses, and the death of Stalin in 1953. This course meets the Dietrich Gen Ed ""Humanities"" requirement.

79273,Jews & Arabs: From the Time of Muhammad to the Present,"What is the history of Arab-Jewish relations beyond the Israel-Palestine conflict and the kinds of violence and animosity commonly depicted in contemporary media coverage of the Middle East? Turning our focus to Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa, this course seeks to answer that question by examining often overlooked aspects of Arab-Jewish relations, including the rich diversity of Jewish cultures native to the MENA region, and the radical transformation of these cultures after their mass migration to the State of Israel after its creation in 1948. We shall study the history of Jews and Arabs who lived as neighbors, in cooperation as well as in conflict, from the rise of Islam in the seventh century to the present day. In doing so, we shall explore the experiences of individuals who lived through periods of major upheavals (including colonialism, imperialism, nationalism and decolonization) in order to understand the impact of these different processes on inter-communal relations across time and space. Our sources will include works of scholarship, primary source texts such as religious queries and government documents, journalistic materials, memoirs, and film. Relevant extra credit events on and off campus will be offered to students as opportunities to expand their learning beyond the classroom.

79275,Introduction to Global Studies,"We live in an increasingly interconnected world, one in which our everyday actions have repercussions across vast distances. To understand this ever-denser web of connections, we must think beyond simplistic accounts of globalization as a uniformly positive, negative, or homogenizing process. Economic crisis, impoverishment, rising inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic disease, and irredentist movements are just as much a part of the story as are technological innovation, digital communication, global supply chains, cultural exchange, the promotion of human rights, and the rise of cosmopolitan values. This course aims to equip you with an interdisciplinary toolkit for thinking critically about the many dimensions of globalization (economic, social, political, cultural) and for engaging thoughtfully with differing experiences of them. By examining how globalization connects and shapes the everyday lives of people around the world, including our own, we will establish a foundation both for your advanced coursework in Global Studies and for your lifelong education as a globally aware professional and citizen.

79280,Coffee and Capitalism,"What role has coffee played in connecting people and places to capitalist markets and consumer cultures? What are the economic, social, and environmental consequences of these connections? How did espresso change from an ""ethnic drink"" to something served at McDonalds? Why do college students (and professors!) hang out in coffee shops? This course will answer these questions and more by using coffee to learn about the history of capitalism, and capitalism to understand the history of coffee. We will follow the spread of coffee and capitalism across the globe, with excursions to places where people grow coffee (Ethiopia, Yemen, Indonesia, Brazil, and Costa Rica), and also where they drink coffee (Seattle, Tokyo, Seoul, New York, and Berlin). In the process, we will confront global problems linked to economic inequality, trade, gender relations, and environmental degradation. Course meetings will combine interactive lecture, group discussions, and mini-presentations. Assignments will include journal responses, ethnographic observations, and writing a short script that tells a story about coffee and capitalism.","['coffee', 'capitalism', 'globalization', 'economic inequality', 'trade', 'gender relations', 'environmental degradation', 'ethnography', 'consumer culture', 'coffee shops']",history,intro
79281,Introduction to Religion,"Religion can be understood from the ""outside,"" through the academic lenses of history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, etc., and from the ""inside,"" listening to the experiences and reflections of those who practice various faiths. The course will examine major religious traditions from several perspectives and begin to explore such topics as the relationship between religion and science, faith and reason, religion and moral values, and religion in public life. This introduction is designed for students with a general interest in religion, as well as those contemplating a Religious Studies minor.","['religion', 'academic', 'history', 'sociology', 'psychology', 'philosophy', 'major traditions', 'perspect0pective', 'faith']",history,intro
79283,Anthropology of Energy,"This class will introduce students to anthropological perspectives on energy. While energy production, distribution, consumption, transition, storage, and disposal are often approached as technological issues or challenges, they are also social practices embedded in complex (and often unequal) cultural, political, and economic relations. Using ethnographic case studies organized around various energy resources, this course will explore how the ideologies and infrastructures of energy create and transform our social world, generating and influencing forms of political power, relationships with the environment, and the everyday experiences of people and communities across the globe.

79288,"Bananas, Baseball, and Borders: Latin America and the United States","This course provides a history of interactions between the United States and Latin America, a part of the world that sends more people to the U.S. than any other macro-region. We will literally discuss bananas, baseball and borders; the course title also alludes to the key themes that we will study: transnational economies, cultural interactions, and geopolitics. We will consider not only important differences between U.S. and Latin American cultures and societies, but also how they have influenced one another. The course uses discussion and written analysis of historical documents and scholarship to encourage students to think about how past actors perceived the world and also draws on non-English language sources (including film and music w/ translations). By examining historical change from a multiplicity of perspectives, the course challenges static stereotypes and monochrome views of ""Latin America."" For example: We explore the role of Indigenous actors in the ""U.S.-Mexico"" war and the role of Cubans in the ""Spanish-American War."" We will also use primary sources to examine diverse domestic perspectives on U.S. government policies. Mondays and Wednesdays will feature interactive lectures, videos and in-class activities; Fridays will be devoted to student-driven discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly takeaway assignments, two analytical papers, micro-research projects, and class participation.

79297,Technology and Work,"In recent years, conversations about the relationship between technology and work seem to have been conducted with particular fervor: claims of revolutionary ease and freedom sit side-by-side with dystopian visions of exploitation, surveillance, and alienation. Will technological development lead to a new ""sharing economy"" or widespread deskilling? Will it bring general prosperity or enrich the few at the expense of the many? These concerns - though especially apparent today - are by no means new. In this course, we will examine their history, focusing in particular on North America and Europe in the past two centuries. We will examine the ways in which new technologies - from the assembly line to the washing machine to the personal computer - transformed what it meant to work, and how workers, their families, and the companies who employed them reacted to these changes. Our historical actors will include famous figures like Henry Ford, but also unnamed women, children, people with disabilities, and racial and ethnic minorities. Throughout, we will pay attention to who benefitted, who was harmed, and what broader economic, cultural, or social purposes these technologies were designed to serve.

79303,Pittsburgh and the Transformation of Modern Urban America,"[Note: students who have already taken this mini course under its previous number 79-303 and title may not enroll.] This course will focus on the transformations, both positive and negative, of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh region in the period from 1945 through the present. It will explore the following themes: the rise of industrial Pittsburgh, the redevelopment of the city in the Pittsburgh Renaissance; urban renewal and its consequences; the collapse of the steel industry and its impacts; the development of an Eds/Meds service economy; air, land and water environmental issues; and the city's changing demography.","['transformations', 'pittsburgh', 'industrial rise', 'pittsburgh renaissance', 'urban renewal', 'steel industry collapse', 'edsmeds economy', 'environmental issues']",history,intermediate
79305,Global Perspectives in LGBTQ+ History,"In the half century since the Stonewall Uprising, a social revolution has occurred. With Lesbians and Gay men have been accorded civil liberties and individual rights, Trans individuals have been recognized as a discrete minority, and the once rigid binaries of gender, sexuality and identity have become increasing labile and fluid. Alongside these gains, there have been reversals, backlashes, and attacks against LGBTQ individuals both domestically and abroad, notably in the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and emerging African nations as activists assume public identities and confront resistance and violence. If these reversals have a common denominator, gay people have become identified as a constituency that suffers from sanctioned persecution. This course will examine these contrapuntal movements and will utilize a series of case studies that focus on the emergence of a LGBTQ minority and examine them as political identities. These include the international case for gay marriage, the inclusion of gay men and women into armed forces, the impact of AIDS and the emergence of gay identities as political controversies in the Eastern Block, the Arab world, and African republics. Please note: This course is designed as an upper-level seminar, and seniors and juniors will be given priority in admission.","['global lgbtq history', 'civil liberties', 'transgender rights', 'gender fluidity', 'lgbtq backlash', 'lgbtq persecution', 'gay marriage', 'lgbtq military inclusion', 'aids']",history,intermediate
79319,India Through Film,"Bollywood films attract hundreds of millions of viewers, not just in India but throughout the world. The name ""Bollywood"" makes it seem that the Indian film industry is a junior partner, merely an echo of Hollywood. But more films are made in Mumbai every year than in Los Angeles. And Mumbai is only one of many film hubs in India. The rich diversity of Indian cinema speaks to the equally rich history of India itself. This course uses Indian movies to examine several key themes in India's history. We will focus on the twentieth century and on questions of democracy, diversity, and development.

79320,"Women, Politics, and Protest","This course examines the history of women's rights agitation in the United States from the early nineteenth-century to the present. It investigates both well-known struggles for women's equality--including the battles for women's voting rights, an Equal Rights Amendment, and access to birth control--and also explores the history of lesser-known struggles for economic and racial justice. Because women often differed about what the most important issues facing their sex were, this course explores not only the issues that have united women, but also those that have divided them, keeping intersectionality and women's diversity at the center of the course.

79328,Photographers and Photography Since World War II,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles ""Teenie"" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences. As available, students will be expected to make one or more visits to photography exhibitions on view in Pittsburgh (locations to be announced at the first class.)","['photography', 'world war ii', 'documentary', 'lewis hine', 'alfred stieglitz', 'helen levitt', 'w eugene smith', 'robert frank', 'diane arbus', 'garry winogrand']",history,intermediate
79331,Body Politics: Women and Health in America,"This course takes a topical, intersectional approach to the history of U.S. women's health in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is less about governmental politics, although we do some of that. Rather, it sees bodies as cultural texts through which power is built and contested. The course covers topics such as the history of anatomy, menstruation, reproductive rights, body image, mental health, sexuality, violence, childbirth, and menopause. We explore how science and American culture both have constructed these issues over time (some of it is super whacky!), while also examining women's organizing around them.

79338,History of Education in America,"Americans have long understood schools both as mechanisms for inculcating communal values and as instruments for social reform. Schools have been alternatively described as pillars of democratic society and as authoritarian institutions for managing deviance. Institutions of education - whether schools, colleges, or universities - figure prominently in discussions of inequality and discrimination, opportunity and meritocracy. This course provides an introductory historical survey of American educational ideas and institutions. From debates in the 17th and 18th centuries over the proper balance of religious and secular education to fierce battles today over the role of the federal government, citizens have been politically mobilized through their concerns about education. By understanding the complicated history of American educational ideas and institutions, this course prepares students to engage critically with ongoing debates about the curriculum, vouchers, charter schools, and national standards.","['solutionamerican education', 'communal values', 'social reform', 'democratic society', 'authoritarian institutions', 'inequality', 'discrimination', 'opportunity', 'meritocracy', 'historical survey']",history,intermediate
79345,Roots of Rock & Roll,"This course is about open source, collaborative innovation, and the impact of social and technological change on American music. We will spend the first half on early ""remix"" music (slave songs, Anglo-Appalachian ballads, ragtime, and Depression era blues and country). After studying Bessie Smith, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Hank Williams, and other early artists, we'll spend the second half on revolutionaries like Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin. The format is informal lecture and discussion. Assignments include reading two books plus some articles, listening to short Spotify playlists, and writing three short essays.

79352,"Christianity Divided: The Protestant and Catholic Reformations, 1450-1650","At the dawn of the sixteenth century, most western Europeans shared a common religious identity as members of the Roman Catholic Church. Within less than two decades, this consensus began to crumble, and the very fabric of western culture was irrevocably altered. By 1550, Europe was splintered into various conflicting churches, confessions, sects, and factions, each with its own set of truths and its own plan for reforming the church and society at large. This period of rapid and unprecedented change in western history is commonly known as the Reformation. Though this term has traditionally referred to the birth of Protestantism, it also encompasses the simultaneous renewal and reform that occurred within Roman Catholicism. This course will survey the Reformations of the sixteenth century, both Protestant and Catholic, examining the causes of the Reformation, the dynamics of reform, and its significance for western society and culture. In the process, we will analyze such on-going problems as religious persecution and the accommodation of dissent, the relationship between religion and politics, and the interactions between ideology and political, social, and economic factors in the process of historical change.","['reformation', 'protestantism', 'catholicism', 'religious identity', 'western culture', 'religious persecution', 'dissent', 'politics', 'ideology']",history,intermediate

It traces the development of South Asia through film and highlights the changing images of the region since the 1950s. In addition to outlining the political history of South Asia, themes of nation-building, political culture, corruption, inequality, and social tension based on gender, caste, religion, region, and language, as well as transnational/global South Asian cinema, will be addressed.","['south asian cinema', 'political culture', 'corruption', 'inequality', 'gender', 'caste', 'religion', 'region', 'language']",history,intermediate
79365,"Race, Medicine, and Civil Rights","Health policy scholar David Barton Smith asserts that the modern health care system came of age in the Jim Crow, ""separate but equal"" era. As such, the social and political motivations of the era were deeply embedded into the developing system. Yet the relationship between health activism, health policy, and Black liberation is not fully understood. Students taking this course will be introduced to the nexus of the history of medicine and African American history using the important case of the ""Medical Civil Rights Movement."" The course proceeds roughly chronologically, a deep dive into the questions of racial segregation and integration in the spheres of medicine and public health. Such a lens helps students understand, perhaps more viscerally, how racism and segregation have severely impacted and impeded black experiences in the United States. But the course also seeks to complicate students' understandings of segregation and desegregation in medicine and public health. Students will be encouraged, throughout the course to ask: Was there a ""Medical Civil Rights Movement?"" If so, who were its major actors? What were its main motivations and contributions? When and how did it occur? What did it achieve? What wasn't achieved? How does the history of medical civil rights fit into larger movements for liberation and equality? Students taking this course are encouraged, though not required, to have some familiarity with the United States civil rights movement, either through previous coursework or independent study.

79380,Hostile Environments: The Politics of Pollution in Global Perspective,"Earth is an increasingly toxic planet. Fossil-fueled industrialization, chemical engineering, and resource-intensive consumerism have generated immense wealth, but they have also left long-term, cumulative legacies of toxic pollution and ecological harm. While these legacies affect everyone, their impacts are by no means evenly distributed. In this course, we will use the tools of anthropology, political ecology, and history to examine experiences of toxic exposure in different parts of the world, including Pittsburgh. Our analyses will ask how inequalities of race, class, gender, and ability shape exposure as well as how cultural differences create divergent understandings of ecology, health, and their interrelationship. We will consider, moreover, how these disparities shape what people know about pollution and whether/how they demand accountability for it. Cases we explore will range from acute industrial disasters (and their aftermath) to the harms experienced by other-than-human beings to the gradual, often invisible exposures that affect all of us to varying degrees.

79381,The Multispecies City:  Anthropology of Urban Environments,"Cities are built environments, but they are also ecosystems that entangle human lives with those of animals, plants, and microbes. Cities use complex infrastructures to control the flow of traffic, energy, waste, and other matter, but these technologies are always shaped (and at times overcome) by a changing climate and other ""forces of nature."" Even the social inequalities that stratify human urbanites along lines of race, class, gender, and ability have an ecological dimension - not just in the spatial effects of segregation, gentrification, and disinvestment, but also in the specific assemblages of life that coexist in the city. In this course, we will use methods and theories from multispecies ethnography, science and technology studies, and environmental history to understand cities as unbounded, more-than-human spaces. Through case studies and field research, we will learn to trace the everyday interactions of organisms, infrastructures, politics, and biophysical forces - and to connect them to societal structures and global change. We will see how today's cities lay bare the limits of technological innovation, but also serve as vital sites of agricultural experimentation, eco-political activism, and regenerative design.","['multispecies ethnography', 'urban environments', 'ecosystems', 'infrastructures', 'social inequalities', 'environmental history', 'technological innovation', 'agricultural experimentation', 'eco-political activism', 'regenerative design']",history,intermediate

This course will examine the social and cultural context of the rise of Fascism in Spain. We will focus especially on the colonial legacy of Spanish fascism, the violent overthrow of the democratic II Spanish Republic and Franco's seizure of power during the bloody Spanish Civil War. We will have the opportunity to learn about the international volunteers, including from the United States, who joined the fight against fascism and how the Spanish Civil War was decisive in shaping WWII. We will also discuss the decades of Franco's lengthy dictatorship, the social and cultural politics in transitioning Spain to democracy after his death and the legacy of Spanish Fascism in contemporary Spain. In addition to class lectures, students will become familiar with these themes through the reading and analysis of historical texts and memoirs, participation in a workshop with the director of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades Archives, the viewing of documentary film, and by engaging with the current volatile debates in Spain about the historical memory of fascism.

66133,DC Grand Challenge Seminar: We're Not Beyond Race: Race and Identity in America,"Race matters. How have social institutions and historical factors led to the belief systems and stereotypes that shape how race is experienced in American society, and how do these belief systems affect the way individuals come to view and define themselves and others? This course considers how race and identity affect people's lived experiences - how they think, feel, and act - in America. In this course, we will examine the structural and systemic origins of the racial status quo, as well as the way that individuals navigate the social and racial landscape of modern-day America. Including insights from psychology, literature, economics, sociology, and history, the course will focus on how race matters at both a societal level and an individual level. We will consider different racial situations throughout American society to understand how individuals navigate and experience race and identity. Throughout the course, we will watch films, read literature, and analyze music and art that reflect the experience of race and identity.","['race', 'identity', 'america', 'social institutions', 'historical factors', 'belief systems', 'stereotypes', 'lived experiences', 'psychology', 'literature']",arts & culture,intro
66143,DC Grand Challenge Seminar:Realizing Human Rights:The Challenge of Achieving Jus,"This course will introduce first year students to the challenge of protecting and promoting human rights in a world fraught with conflict, political strife, economic exploitation, and environmental hazards. We will focus on how human rights frameworks can be used to make the world more just, equitable, and free. We will begin by discussing the theoretical foundations of human rights and the development of human rights institutions in the 20th century. Students will learn how rights have been constructed through legal action, activism, and treaty negotiations in the past and examine the emergence and contestation of new rights today. We will explore why particular rights frameworks are privileged in some societies but not others. We will then focus on how practitioners investigate and document potential rights violations around the world, including in our own backyard. The course will feature numerous guest lectures by legal experts, scientists, human rights practitioners, and people who have been impacted by human rights violations. Topics covered will include genocide and other war crimes; political repression; economic, social, and cultural rights; environmental rights; migration and refugees; gender identity and sexuality; indigenous rights; and the U.S. criminal legal system. By the end of semester, students will be prepared to conduct collaborative research on, and propose an collective action plan to address, a specific human rights challenge that matters to them.","['human rights', 'conflict', 'political strife', 'economic exploitation', 'environmental hazards', 'justice', 'equity', 'freedom', 'rights frameworks', 'legal action']",public policy & social sciences,intro
66153,DC Grand Challenge First Year Seminar: TL;DR Cultures and Challenges of Reading,"Recent headlines (and data) suggest we have a growing reading problem. How much and well we read is increasingly a question, in and out of the classroom, from concerns about whether students have ever read a novel to shifting understandings of literacy in the age of AI. At the same time, from #BookTok to the popularity of audiobooks, new ways of engaging with the written word have emerged for and from enthusiastic readers. Using an interdisciplinary lens based in literary studies, library science, sociology, and technology, this course asks: why, where, and how do you read? What influences your choices? What makes something end up in your TBR pile or results in a DNF? This course offers a deep dive into the history, present, and future of reading, from technologies of reading to socio-cultural influences on reading for pleasure, education, and work. Over the course of the semester, students will analyze how technology, social structures, and institutional power have shaped the act of reading over time. We'll explore reading as both a personal practice and a social phenomenon, critically examining how and where we read—privately and publicly, individually and collectively, on the page and in our ears. And we'll take a close look at the myriad forces that shape our reading habits, from book clubs and #BookTok to blurbs and bans. Through engagement with guest speakers, field trips to libraries and bookstores, and hands-on research, students examine current barriers to reading and work to find solutions. Students will have the opportunity to work on individual and collaborative projects such as reflections on their own reading habits, creating book awards and marketing campaigns in their favorite genre, and designing a survey and reading campaign targeting the CMU community.","['literacy', 'technology', 'sociology', 'library science', 'book culture', 'reading habits', 'book clubs', 'audiobooks']",public policy & social sciences,intro
66154,"DC Grand Challenge First Year Seminar: AI, Humanity, Future of Knowledge Creativ","This course addresses the complex challenge of understanding the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI), humanity, and the humanities. It examines how AI transforms humanity's understanding of intelligence, creativity, and knowledge at both individual and societal levels, while introducing new cultural and ethical dilemmas in the process. Additionally, it explores how the discipline of the humanities—traditionally focused on human culture, history, and meaning—adapts to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI. A defining feature of this course is its emphasis on intercultural and interdisciplinary perspectives, to ensure that students are exposed to a wide range of viewpoints that critically examine the multifaceted ways in which AI influences and is influenced by different cultures, disciplines, values, and traditions. Guest speakers from various fields, including Information Systems, Cultural Studies, Digital Humanities, Computer Science, Engineering, Business, and more, will be invited to share their expertise and insights. Students will engage with critical questions such as how AI challenges traditional boundaries between humans and machines, how the humanities adapt to new forms of machine intelligence, creativity, and knowledge production, how AI systems can perpetuate biases that threaten cultural diversity, and how humanity and the humanities can collaborate to shape AI for ethical and inclusive progress.","['ai', 'humanity', 'knowledge', 'creativity', 'ethics', 'cultural diversity', 'interdisciplinary', 'intercultural', 'machine intelligence', 'humanities']",computer science & engineering,intro
66155,"DC Grand Challenge Seminar: Sports Betting, Highs and Lows:Your Brain on Stats","The Supreme Court's 2018 decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association struck down the federal ban on sports betting. Since then, the United States sports betting industry has rapidly grown into a $10 billion industry. By 2023, 67% of all college students were betting on games, according to a study from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Gambling experts believe that number is likely higher now thanks in large part to the pervasiveness of apps (e.g. DraftKings or FanDuel). Anyone in a state with legalized sports betting can download a popular retail sportsbook app and place a bet in seconds. In this course, we will explore sports betting through the lens of statistics, cognition and neuroscience. We will discuss the probabilities underlying the vast menu of sports bets and the difficulties in estimating these probabilities reliably. In parallel, we will consider cognitive biases in decision making, the neural substrates of decision making in the social and emotional brain, and how these processes can change with addiction. As part of this class, students will participate in discussions and collaborate on various assignments such as placing bets on real sporting events through a fake sportsbook to actively demonstrate the lessons covered throughout the semester.","['probability', 'cognitive biases', 'neuroscience', 'addiction', 'ncaa', 'apps', 'draftkings']",mathematics,intro
66182,Grand Challenges Seminar: Preserving History with Blockchain Technology: Preserving History with Blockchain Technology,"Historical information, artifacts, and relics provide a window to our past and help us understand our present and foresee and prepare for the future. During times of conflict and internecine warfare, it is essential to preserve objects of historical and cultural heritage. Blockchain is a block of data chained together. It does three noteworthy things: 1. digitization, 2. tracing, and 3. security. For any non-digital historical data, Blockchain can provide digitization. For any data that requires tracing, such as scientific findings, religious information, or scriptures (including Hadith/sayings of the Prophet (s)), so on, tracing can play a pivotal role in going back to the originator and understanding the change on the way, as well as preserving it from any changes (which is part of security). Blockchain also involves a mining process, which includes stakeholders that audit the information of any newly added block of data, making Blockchain auditable, which is significant for history. Using topics from blockchain technology, history, preservation, and science, this course provides students with the grand challenge of understanding how bitcoin and cryptocurrency can assist in providing potential solutions to the problems of authorship, impermanence, managing shared ownership, and stewardship of artifacts taken through war or colonialism. Many institutions and archives are considering and advocating the merits of blockchain-based repositories. In this Grand Challenge course, we want to examine how the seemingly opposed fields of study - history and blockchain technology - can be synergized to create a futuristic museum that captures monuments and artifacts, making them accessible to future generations.","['blockchain', 'digitization', 'security', 'historical artifacts', 'cultural heritage', 'preservation', 'shared ownership', 'stewardship', 'museum']",arts & culture,intro

However, the USA's private sector freight rail industry is considered a model for the world as the result of its renaissance following deregulation in 1980. This is a ""stealth"" industry whose history and economics are both intertwined and complex. Students will gain a basic understanding of the industry's history and economics and its role in the national transportation network, with special attention to the past half-century. In addition, students will participate in small group research projects in particular areas of special interest - for example, economic history, industry and safety culture, network economics, utility regulation or transportation policy.","['railroads', 'usa', 'freight', 'deregulation', 'renaissance', 'economics', 'transportation', 'history', 'research', 'policysolution 0railroads']",public policy & social sciences,intro

Even those not specifically interested in law will benefit from the medium we use, which is that of imaginative fiction. Scenes from stories (and some films and popular culture media) that deal with law provoke our discussions, including well known trial scenes (MERCHANT OF VENICE [Shakespeare], BILLY BUDD SAILOR [Melville]), portraits of men and women in the profession of law (GREAT EXPECTATIONS [Dickens], THE FALL [Camus], ""A Jury of Her Peers"" [Glaspell]; and narratives that show how the rhetoric of law sometimes fails to grasp the problems of less powerful communities (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD [Lee]; THE FIXER [Malamud]. Students will want to read these and other stories, and to screen films and TV shows about law, with some care, so the course always links the skill of reading well with the policies of a sound approach to the institutions of power. There is no final exam, but there will be a final paper of the student's choosing as discussed with the instructor, and other shorter responsibilities during the semester. The instructor will work closely on each student's writing skills as the semester proceeds. Richard Weisberg has taught both law and English Literature for many years, has practiced law in New York and in federal court, has been an appointee of Pres.

Entrepreneurship is a key part of an economy's search for new solutions that increase customer value. Why is it a search? Because, when the conditions surrounding a contemplated new product are uncertain, the answers to key questions are not known apriori. What features are actually needed? Does the product in fact solve the problem we think it does for the users? Are they willing to pay enough for the product to make bringing it to market profitable? Ultimately, entrepreneurship is a critical part of the growth engine that improves a society's standard of living. In this course, we look at how to facilitate this search process and hopefully maximize the chance of bringing a successful new product to market.","['entrepreneurship', 'new product development', 'uncertainty', 'customer value', 'profitability', 'growth engine', 'market search', 'product features']",business & management,intermediate

4616,Tech Startups: Tools and Techniques,"The first three years of a technology start-up, when the company's DNA or trajectory is set, are the most critical. Too few entrepreneurs appreciate this fact and, as a result, many start without the essential skills, talents, and capabilities needed to set the company on a successful path. Some of these entrepreneurial skills can only be learned through starting and growing a business while others can be learned. This course bridges the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship. We introduce the essential skill of market discovery, or learning to create, develop and evaluate your concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product, or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where? Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies, role-playing, and solving actual problems of local tech businesses. The best way to learn entrepreneurship is by doing, so the course will use true-to-life scenarios. The class will be divided into teams and will focus on a company that is either (1) a student idea for a new start-up, (2) an existing start-up (ideally local), or (3) a hypothetical start-up proposed/conceived by the students, the professor, or both.","['technology start-up', 'entrepreneurship', 'market discovery', 'business concept', 'innovation', 'market size', 'competitive risks', 'product development', 'case studies']",business & management,intermediate

95819,"A/B Testing, Design and Analysis","This course looks at how A/B testing helps measure causal effects across different industries and fields of public policy studies. We aim at answering questions such as: how does the demand for a product change when the price does or the ratings do? how can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? how can we measure whether introducing technology in schools, universities and/or classrooms affects the performance of students? Many companies and Governmental Agencies ask and try to answer questions of this type every day. Moreover they are now also actively seeking tools that can take advantage of big datasets to answer these questions as well as skillful individuals that know how to use them confidently. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in different settings. The examples discussed in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at Heinz College on the media industry and education policy. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts related to A/B testing and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study several real-world datasets and the code used to analyze them properly. Student evaluation is based on five weekly homeworks and a brief team term project.","['causal effects', 'randomized experiments', 'big data', 'education policy', 'media industry', 'experimental design', 'data analysis', 'policy studies', 'business strategy']",information systems,advanced
95828,Machine Learning for Problem Solving,"Machine Learning (ML) is centered around automated methods that improve their own performance through learning patterns in data, and then using the uncovered patterns to predict the future and make decisions. ML is heavily used in a wide variety of domains such as business, finance, healthcare, security, etc. for problems including display advertising, fraud detection, disease diagnosis and treatment, face/speech recognition, automated navigation, to name a few. ""If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions."" -- Albert Einstein ""A problem well put is half solved."" -- John Dewey This course provides graduate students with a comprehensive and practical grounding in modern machine learning. The goal is to build a strong intuitive understanding of machine learning concepts, models, and workflows; anchored in real-world applications rather than abstract theory. ""All models are wrong, but some models are useful."" -- George Box Because there is no universally best model, this course surveys a wide range of machine learning methods and learning paradigms, each offering distinct tradeoffs in speed, accuracy, and interpretability. The curriculum progresses from classical supervised learning—covering linear and logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, kernel, and nonparametric models—to modern deep learning architectures, including neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, transformers, and diffusion models. The course also explores unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction, and concludes with machine learning on specialized data modalities, including tabular, graph, temporal, text, and image data.

95835,Time Series Forecasting in Python,"Time Series Forecasting is something of a dark horse in the field of data science. It is one of the most applied data science techniques in business - used extensively in finance, in supply chain management, and in production and inventory planning. Moreover, it has a well established theoretical grounding in statistics and dynamic systems theory. Yet, it retains something of an outsider status in data science compared to more recent and popular machine learning methods such as image recognition and natural language processing. Consequently, Time Series Forecasting gets little or no treatment at all in introductory data science and machine learning courses. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods without deep diving into the theoretical details behind each method. Although, the references at the end of each week will fill in many of those details. The course is intended for the following three audiences. Graduate students studying in STEM or business fields. People doing forecasting in business who may not have had any formal training in the area. MBA students doing a data elective.

95844,Introduction to Cyber Intelligence,"CCyber intelligence; a phrase often used, but interpreted by government agencies, private companies, and the general public in many different ways. For the purpose of this course, cyber intelligence is the acquisition and analysis of information to identify, track, and predict cyber capabilities, intentions, and activities to offer courses of action that enhance decision making. Students will explore different aspects of the definition to develop an analytic framework capable of discerning the interdependencies of and external influences on cyber intelligence, as it relates to an organization's environment, data gathering, functional analysis, strategic analysis, and decision making. Cyber intelligence will be explored within the context of threat modeling and the cyber kill chain. Students will learn how traditional intelligence practices and emerging technologies influence cyber intelligence; empowering students to assess the likelihood of cyber threat actors executing attacks, the impact attacks have on an organization's business, and the risk threats pose because of an organization's known vulnerabilities.","['cyber intelligence', 'information acquisition', 'cyber capabilities', 'cyber kill chain', 'intelligence practices', 'emerging technologies', 'threat actors', 'organizational vulnerabilities']",information systems,advanced
95851,Making Products Count: Data Science for Product Managers,"Product managers engage in a variety of complex activities critical to product success including -Gathering product requirements -Prioritizing features -Forecasting customer demand -Customer segmentation -Pricing -Allocating marketing spend -Identifying buying patterns -Analyzing and responding to customer feedback Historically decisions in these areas have often relied on intuition and guesswork, leading to misjudgment of the market and other key factors, and ultimately, product failures. Developments in data science, combining the increasing availability of data from internal and external sources with new algorithms that exploit that data at scale, offer new possibilities for putting product management decisions on a more quantitative and rigorous footing. Students in this course will be introduced to a variety of data science techniques applicable to activities to which product managers typically contribute. These techniques include preference modeling, time series forecasting, regression, clustering, classification, A/B testing, and analytics for unstructured data, including clickstreams, text, speech, and images. This course is for students who are looking for an intro to applying data science to product management. Backgrounds in basic stats, and some programming experience are required. Hands-on exercises in Python will illustrate the concepts, but please note this is not a Python class; students who are unfamiliar with Python will be given access to online tutorials to build up their Python skills. In-class exercises and weekly assignments will mainly focus on data science techniques and their application to decision making at various stages of the product life cycle. In the final project, students will select from a variety of data sets to address a product management issue in more depth, from framing the problem through modeling to communicating results.

95865,Unstructured Data Analytics,"Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as ""unstructured"". This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series. We will write lots of Python code and also work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud computing.","['unstructured data', 'data analysis', 'exploratory methods', 'deep neural networks', 'text', 'images', 'time series']",information systems,advanced
95866,Advanced Business Analytics,"Growth in Web 2.0 coincides with the growth in firms¿ ability to collect large customer data. Firms know micro level data about customer transactions and have an ability to correlate such data with other datasets. In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a ¿model¿ of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy. Thus a key goal of the course is to teach students a model based approach to prediction.","['advanced business analytics', 'web', 'customer data', 'probability models', 'statistical models', 'consumer behavior', 'data prediction', 'model-based approach']",information systems,advanced

Since the 2000s, these filmmakers - who originated from France's former colonies in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean - have breathed new life into national cinema and highlighted alternative narratives of French society. This semester's course will focus on Alice Diop, currently one of the most successful French filmmakers. Diop is a young Black woman of Muslim culture, born in the urban peripheries, from an immigrant family of modest means. Each of these seven identities alone make her an outsider in a traditionally Parisian, white, bourgeois and heavily male French cinema environment. Taken together, these characteristics form the main thread of this class: the aesthetics, intersectional identities and universalist aspirations of a new cinema that interrogates well-known visions, myths of and stereotypes about France.

Few moments in life are as moving as listening to the right song at the right time, and many of us can list films and/or books that have shaped who we consider to be. Beyond the individual level, artistic expressions have also influenced revolutions, businesses, science, politics, and the list goes on and on. Yet, we often take culture and artistic expressions for granted. What is their role and value in society? How can we interpret these cultural artifacts? Is there a right or wrong interpretation?

82283,Language Diversity & Cultural Identity,"Culture, language, and identity are intimately tied together.

Students will compare and contrast everyday life in the Russian-speaking world with their own worldview, with special attention given to the cultural and ethnic diversity of the global Russophone community. Students will also utilize Russian-language texts and media to explore the historical formation of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, as well as the relationships between former Soviet republics and the wider world today. Students will also consider the historical development of the Russian language and the influence of other cultures and languages in producing the modern language we speak today.","['russian grammar', 'vocabulary', 'listening comprehension', 'narrative skills', 'conversational skills', 'research project', 'cultural diversity', 'historical formation', 'russian empire', 'soviet union']",modern languages,intro
82294,19th Century Russian Masterpieces,"Russian literature of the 19th century was shaped by its engagement with the so-called accursed questions—""accursed"" for being urgent and inescapable but possibly unanswerable. What is the self? What is the meaning of life and of death? What is truth? What is justice? What does it mean to live a righteous life? In Russia these existential quandaries fell within the purview not only of philosophers but also of the poets and prose writers we will consider in this course. While the course roughly follows the chronology of the 19th century, it is structured around these accursed questions rather than by literary movement or genre. There are two reasons for this. First, Russia's literary culture began to develop later than other traditions; as a result, Russian authors of the 19th century were exposed to many different movements and often participated in several at once. Second, and relatedly, many authors worked across genres and in dialogue with philosophers, critics, novelists, and poets. They published in ""thick journals,"" composed of texts ranging from the literary to the journalistic to the academic. For these reasons, it is difficult to categorize these authors along stylistic or generic lines. As philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev observes, what united them was an abiding interest in the most profound existential questions. Students in this course will examine how an author's use of genre, affiliation with particular literary movements, and socio-political commitments inflected their treatment of the accursed questions. Students will become familiar with not only the cultural artifacts of this fertile century but also the circumstances—historical, cultural, institutional—in which these artifacts were created. They will also be encouraged to reflect on how these perennial accursed questions are articulated at present, and what that reveals about our own socio-political commitments and generic loyalties.","['existential questions', 'philosophical engagement', 'literary movements', 'genre', 'socio-political context', 'cultural artifacts', 'accursed questions', 'literary analysis', 'historical context']",modern languages,intro
82295,20th Century Russian Masterpieces,"At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Empire underwent a series of dramatic changes in quick succession: industrial modernization, the unsuccessful 1905 rebellion, terrible losses in the First World War, finally culminating in the 1917 October Revolution. The literature and culture of the era were deeply impacted by these upheavals as artists and writers of the era attempted to capture and convey the world rapidly shifting around them. This course will acquaint students with canonical texts from 20th-century Russian literature and will also examine the highly specific context in which they were produced. From the fin-de-siècle aesthetics of a crumbling Russian Empire to the avant-garde experimentalism of the Russian Revolution and Civil War era, to the establishment of Socialist Realism and the implementation of a Totalitarian regime under Stalin, the course invites students to think about both the realities of life and artistic production in a rapidly transforming country as well as the ways in which these works bring contemporary readers to the inner lives of Soviet citizens.","['russian literature', '20th century', 'russian empire', 'industrial modernization', '1905 rebellion', 'world war i', 'october revolution', 'avant-garde', 'socialist realism', 'stalin']",modern languages,intro

We will trace the cultural and political movements that have both influenced and been influenced by the French language, from early modern nation-building and imperialism to contemporary questions of globalization, creolization, francophonie, and linguistic diversity and inclusivity. Students will engage with a variety of materials including fiction, essays, political writings, visual documents, and cultural theory to understand how French has evolved as a tool of domination, resistance, and change. Coursework will develop students' skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, as well as critical thinking and textual analysis.

The course explores these questions by examining representative Spanish-language materials created in the region from the pre-Columbian period to the present. These materials will include literary texts, art, films, and elements of popular culture. We will consider important moments and movements that have shaped the course of the region's history and politics, such as conquest and colonization, wars of independence and constitution of nation-states, Mexican and Cuban Revolutions, and the rise of Latin American youth countercultures, as well as current events and challenges. This course is part of the post-intermediate, 300-level program that forms the introduction to the major or minor in Spanish. In addition to enriching cultural proficiency by improving an understanding of Latin America, its people and its cultures, and developing critical skills in a progression from comprehension to analysis and interpretation, the course advances grammatical accuracy and verbal communication in the Spanish language. The in-class setting will be student-centered, and thus highly interactive. Assignments will include reflective essays, individualized research, and the generation, expression, analysis, and re-writing of ideas. Reading and writing skills will be complemented by continued oral practice in the form of small and large group discussions and class presentations. The class is conducted entirely in Spanish.","['cultures', 'latin', 'america', 'what', 'american', 'questions', 'representative', 'spanish-language']",modern languages,intermediate
82347,Spanish for Heritage Speakers,"This Spanish course is geared towards heritage learners—students who have been exposed to Spanish, often by speaking it at home, and therefore have familiarity with the language outside of an academic formal setting. The course will build upon the knowledge and foundations of such student to gain literacy and fluency in other forms of Spanish. As such, students will improve their speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. Instruction of the Spanish language and being exposed to other forms of Spanish is desirable in a professional environment, but this class also values the students' cultural and personal connection to the language, believing that learning about students' own heritage is a source of enrichment as well. Students will be exposed to the Spanish language under different scenarios and via distinct genres of literary and non-literary texts, always keen to the specific needs of heritage learners. Students should expect to develop written assignments, complete readings, speak in class and among themselves, work individually and in groups, and carry out presentations. The class will be held completely in Spanish.","['heritage learners', 'spanish language', 'literacy', 'fluency', 'cultural connection', 'heritage']",modern languages,intermediate

82388,Topics in Second Language Acquisition: Language Policy and Planning,"Undergrad number for 82888 SECTION A, Language Policy and Planning: According to the Center for Applied Linguistics, ""Decisions around language policy and planning are made around the globe every day, both formally by governments and informally by scholars and community leaders. These decisions influence the right to use and maintain languages, affect language status, and determine which languages are nurtured. Language policy and planning decisions have a major impact on language vitality and, ultimately, on the rights of the individual."" In this course, we will discuss the main concepts, theories, and research paradigms associated with the field of Language Policy and Planning (LPP) in multilingual educational contexts at the international, national, local, or institutional levels. Specific topics may include: official language decisions, language standardization, instructional medium choices, foreign/heritage/second language pedagogy and policy, indigenous language revitalization efforts, mother tongue instruction, language rights, and linguistic landscape. SECTION C: This graduate course examines theoretical, empirical, and pedagogical perspectives on how instruction shapes second language acquisition and development. Topics include skill development (listening, speaking, reading, writing, and integrated skills), acquisition of linguistic and pragmatic features, key issues in instructed second language acquisition (ISLA; e.g., interaction, focus on form, individual differences) and the role of emerging technologies (e.g., AI) in ISLA in classroom settings.

82394,"Russian for Heritage Speakers: Babushkas, Russia & Beyond","A mad copy clerk declares himself the King of Spain. A nightmarish visit to a local museum somehow spirits a Russian refugee back to the Soviet Union. A bespectacled Jewish reporter brutally kills a goose to earn the respect of his Cossack platoon. Although Russian literature is famous for its long 19th-century novels, the absurdities of Russian society were explored no less profoundly in short stories by Gogol, Chekhov, Nabokov, Babel, and many others. This course examines the Russian short story as a form particularly suited to revealing the barbarism, hilarity, and ecstasy of human experience. This course is designed to address the linguistic and cultural learning needs of heritage speakers of Russian, those who grew up hearing and speaking Russian at home but who have had little or no formal study of Russian language, culture, or history. Although heritage speakers of Russian often achieve advanced or near-native listening comprehension skills, they require further training in reading, writing, and speaking. Heritage speakers may also be unfamiliar with important aspects of Russian culturekey events in Russian and Soviet history, well-known cultural phenomena, literary works, films, and so onand have gaps in their knowledge of social norms. Russian for Heritage Speakers aims to fill these gaps through a combination of grammar instruction and student-led close analysis of texts and audiovisual material. The course is organized around five thematic units that allow students to learn about Russian culture while engaging in interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational modes of communication: ""Foundations: Truth & Legends,"" ""Revolutions: Political, Cultural, Social,"" ""Student Life: ' ,'"" ""Russia in the World,"" and ""Individual and Community.""","['russian short story', 'russian culture', 'heritage speakers', 'grammar instruction', 'interpretive communication', 'interpersonal communication', 'presentational communication', 'russian history', 'russian society', 'cultural phenomena']",modern languages,intermediate

Speaking a language is rarely a neutral act—it is inextricable from the histories, myths, and hierarchies that have shaped its evolution and global usage. Spanning the 16 th century to the present day, this course explores how power and identity are negotiated through language across French-speaking regions. We will trace the cultural and political movements that have both influenced and been influenced by the French language, from early modern nation-building and imperialism to contemporary questions of globalization, creolization, francophonie, and linguistic diversity and inclusivity. Students will engage with a variety of materials including fiction, essays, political writings, visual documents, and cultural theory to understand how French has evolved as a tool of domination, resistance, and change.

Awareness of the ideologies and contexts that shape languages--and the teaching and learning of languages--allows one to understand and respect learner experience, interact effectively with language learners, design relevant curricula and materials, and potentially disrupt inequities that confront language learners daily. This course will introduce students to scholarship and pedagogies commonly found in CLA as a foundation for their own teaching, tutoring, consulting, and interacting with language learners in a variety of contexts. Through an exploration of communication skills and strategies (productive and receptive language skills, pronunciation and accent modification, etc.), students will investigate multiple approaches to language learner support. Course presentations, readings, discussions, and assignments will require students to think critically about teaching and research practices, the values on which those activities are based, and ways to challenge and transform the biases inherent in them. Students will also reflect on and evaluate a variety of instructional, sociocultural, cognitive, and linguistic dimensions of language learning, focusing on how these dimensions are expressed and experienced differently across various spaces, identities, technologies, and learner abilities. The main purpose of the course experience is to equip students with the information and analytical skills to support the diverse needs of language learners they will encounter in their future work.","['language awareness', 'critical language awareness', 'language learners', 'language diversity', 'language equity', 'language pedagogy', 'language research', 'language practices']",modern languages,advanced

Students will implement language technologies for their languages. In the course of creating the languages, students will learn about the building blocks of human language such as phones, phonemes, morphemes, and morpho-syntactic constructions including their semantics and pragmatics. Class instruction will focus specifically on variation among human languages so that the students can make conlangs that are not just naively English-like. We will also touch on philosophical issues in philosophy of language and on real-world socio-political issues related to language policy. Students will be required to use at least one of the following technologies: language documentation tools that are used for field linguistics and corpus annotation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, morphological analysis, parsing, or machine translation. Learning Objectives: 1. The building blocks (phonemes, morphemes, etc.) of language, how languages are built from them, and how they interact 2. Metalinguistic awareness and knowledge about variation in human language 3. Language, thought, and culture: how does language reflect thought and culture, and vice versa.

10701,Introduction to Machine Learning,"Machine learning studies the question: ""how can we build adaptive algorithms that automatically improve their performance (on a given task) as they acquire more experience?"" This can cover a dizzying array of technologies depending on what sort of task we have in mind, and we take to constitute experience. Through this framing, we might view classical statistics problems, like estimating the likelihood that a coin lands on heads as an ML problem: the task is to produce an estimate, and the experience would consist of observations. But ML can also include robotics challenges, where the experience is acquired dynamically as our artificial agent interacts with the real world. Other grand challenges in machine learning relate to personalized medicine, natural language processing, and most recently generating media artifacts like photographs and essays (but don't ask chatGPT to do your homework). This course is designed to give PhD students a solid foundation in the methods, mathematics, and algorithms of modern machine learning. Students entering the class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics and algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that anyone with a strong mathematical and computer science background can catch up and fully participate. If you are interested in this topic, but are not a PhD student, or are a PhD student not specializing in machine learning, you might consider the master's level course on Machine Learning, 10-601.

10725,Optimization for Machine Learning,"Nearly every problem in machine learning can be formulated as the optimization of some function, possibly under some set of constraints. This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems, though we will discuss some recent advances in nonconvex optimization. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate.

02331,Modeling Evolution,"Some of the most serious public health problems we face today, from drug-resistant bacteria, to cancer, all arise from a fundamental property of living systems -- their ability to evolve. Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection.

Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought.

The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product, a change in practice, or a legal statute. Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting. The questions to be considered include: What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable? What is the pathway from laboratory to practice? What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice? The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students. They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary. The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.

Students work in interdisciplinary teams with an industry sponsor to produce a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of a novel service or product idea. The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs. The end goal is a working prototype that serves as a proof of concept of the product idea.

05795,Applications of Cognitive Science,"The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally. The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product, a change in practice, or a legal statute. Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting. The questions to be considered include: What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable? What is the pathway from laboratory to practice? What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice? The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students. They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary. The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition. These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.","['cognitive science', 'virtual reality', 'cognitive tutors', 'latent semantic analysis', 'consumer attitudes', 'case studies', 'laboratory to practice', 'barriers', 'discussion']",design & hci,advanced
05818,Design Educational Games,"The potential of digital games to improve education is enormous. However, it is a significant challenge to create a game that is both fun and educational. In this course, students will learn to meet this challenge by combining processes and principles from game design and instructional design. Students will also learn to evaluate their games for fun, learning, and the integration of the two. They will be guided by the EDGE framework for the analysis and design educational games. The course will involve a significant hands-on portion in which students learn a design process to create educational games, digital or non-digital. They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysis to the class. The intended audience includes graduate and advanced undergraduate students in HCII, CS, ETC, Design, and students interested in education or psychology research. To be eligible to enroll, students must have successfully completed one course in human-computer interaction, game design, computer science, or cognitive/educational psychology, or they must have instructor permission. During most weeks, we will have a lecture and a course meeting devoted to student game presentations, discussion of homework assignments, and hands-on work.

05833,"Gadgets, Sensors and Activity Recognition in HCI","Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a user's context and actions. This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations the skills needed to actually build devices. About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area. The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: ""HCI gadgets""). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models. The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student. There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded).

05834,Applied Machine Learning,"Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization. 05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

Entrepreneurship is a key part of an economy's search for new solutions that increase customer value. Why is it a search? Because, when the conditions surrounding a contemplated new product are uncertain, the answers to key questions are not known apriori. What features are actually needed? Does the product in fact solve the problem we think it does for the users? Are they willing to pay enough for the product to make bringing it to market profitable? Ultimately, entrepreneurship is a critical part of the growth engine that improves a society's standard of living. In this course, we look at how to facilitate this search process and hopefully maximize the chance of bringing a successful new product to market.","['entrepreneurship', 'new product development', 'uncertainty', 'customer value', 'profitability', 'growth engine', 'market search', 'product features']",information & communication technology,advanced

04616,Tech Startups: Tools and Techniques,"The first three years of a technology start-up, when the company's DNA or trajectory is set, are the most critical. Too few entrepreneurs appreciate this fact and, as a result, many start without the essential skills, talents, and capabilities needed to set the company on a successful path. Some of these entrepreneurial skills can only be learned through starting and growing a business while others can be learned. This course bridges the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship. We introduce the essential skill of market discovery, or learning to create, develop and evaluate your concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product, or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where? Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies, role-playing, and solving actual problems of local tech businesses.

27754,Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials,"Engineers employ all classes of materials (metals, polymers, ceramics and hybrids) in load-bearing applications. To reduce material cost, save energy and maximize performance, engineering materials are frequently designed to be used near their load-bearing limits. An understanding of underlying deformation mechanisms complements a design rule approach in that unexpected failures can be far better anticipated and hence minimized. This course will survey the major deformation mechanisms in the main materials classes. Topics will include structure, elasticity, continuum failure models, fracture mechanics, and plastic deformation mechanisms of polymers, fiber- reinforced, composites, ceramics and metals. Proper design practice and real-life failures will be discussed.","['materials', 'deformation mechanisms', 'engineering materials', 'elasticity', 'continuum failure models', 'fracture mechanics', 'plastic deformation', 'polymers', 'composites']",materials science & engineering,advanced

Reaction times in ironmaking and steelmaking process vary quite widely; the fundamental origins of the large differences in reaction time are analyzed, after a brief overview of the main reactions and process steps in ironmaking and steelmaking. Particular skills to be practiced and developed include derivation of the mathematical relationships which describe the rates of metallurgical processes which involve heat transfer, and mass transfer for solid-gas, liquid-gas and liquid-liquid reactions; quantifying the expected rates of such reactions; identification of rate-determining steps, based on calculated rates and observed reaction rates; predicting the effects of process parameters such as particle size, stirring, temperature and chemical compositions of phases on the overall rate; and critical evaluation of kinetic data and models in scientific papers on metallurgical reactions.","['kinetics', 'metallurgical reactions', 'rate-determining steps', 'heat transfer', 'mass transfer', 'solid-gas', 'liquid-gas', 'liquid-liquid', 'reaction rates', 'process parameters']",materials science & engineering,advanced
27765,Nanostructered Materials,"This course is an introduction to nanostructured materials or nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are objects with sizes larger than the atomic or molecular length scales but smaller than microstructures with at least one dimension in the range of 1-100 nm. The physical and chemical properties of these materials are often distinctively different from bulk materials. For example, gold nanoparticles with diameters ~15 nm are red and ~40 nm gold nanoparticles are purple whereas bulk gold has a golden color. The course starts with a discussion of top-down and bottom-up fabrication methods for making nanostructures as well as how to image and characterize nanomaterials including scanning probe microscopies. Emerging nanomaterials such as fullerenes, graphene, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots and nanocomposites are also discussed. The course then focuses on applications of nanomaterials to microelectronics, particularly nanoscale devices and the emerging field of molecular-scale electronics. The miniaturization of integrated systems that sense mechanical or chemical changes and produce as electrical signal is presented. The principles and applications of the quantum confinement effects on optical properties are discussed, mainly as sensors. The last part of the course is a discussion of nanoscale mechanisms in biomimetic systems and how these phenomena are applied in new technologies including molecular motors.","['nanomaterials', 'fabrication', 'characterization', 'fullerenes', 'graphene', 'carbon nanotubes', 'quantum dots', 'nanocomposites', 'microelectronics', 'molecular-scale electronics']",materials science & engineering,advanced

57455,Shaping Time in Performance,"This course will look at basic questions that performers face: Which level of pulse do I want to feel as the main one? How can I shape a pulse expressively? Which measure in a phrase is felt as a main goal, especially when the phrase contains an unusual number of measures? How can multiple tempi be meaningfully related? Among many important formal arrival points, which are the most important? In addition to these questions, we will also look at recent work on ways in which 18th-century musicians may have understood meter very differently from most musicians today. These alternate perspectives open new possibilities for hearing and shaping the flow of musical time in baroque and classical music. These issues will be pursued from two directions. We will develop simple theoretical tools that can make score analysis a helpful input to the decisions that performers make about such questions. We will also examine audio and video recordings by famous artists to see both how they dealt with these issues and what new questions are raised. Week-to-week work will include reading, listening, and score analysis. Students will write term papers that either use one of the main perspectives developed in class (starting from scores or starting from recordings) or else combine the two. They will also give presentations about their projects to the class.","['performance', 'pulse', 'expression', 'measure', 'tempo', 'formal arrival', '18th-century', 'musicians', 'meter', 'score analysis']",arts & culture,intermediate

The applications range from the biblical David's therapeutic harp playing in the court of King Saul (11th C. BCE) to U.S. interrogators in Iraq (21st C. CE); from Vodun and exorcisms in other cultures to MUZAK in our own. In short, it's a chronological survey of what peoples have believed about music's powers and, consequently, how music has been used and abused. The dialectic between theory and applications is reflected in the assignments. This seminar is heavily focused on reading, as well as written and verbal discussion.

Which measure in a phrase is felt as a main goal, especially when the phrase contains an unusual number of measures? How can multiple tempi be meaningfully related? Among many important formal arrival points, which are the most important? In addition to these questions, we will also look at recent work on ways in which 18th-century musicians may have understood meter very differently from most musicians today. These alternate perspectives open new possibilities for hearing and shaping the flow of musical time in baroque and classical music. These issues will be pursued from two directions. We will develop simple theoretical tools that can make score analysis a helpful input to the decisions that performers make about such questions. We will also examine audio and video recordings by famous artists to see both how they dealt with these issues and what new questions are raised. Week-to-week work will include reading, listening, and score analysis. Students will write term papers that either use one of the main perspectives developed in class (starting from scores or starting from recordings) or else combine the two.

This course is survey of current approaches to and theories about the perception and cognition of music. Topics covered include psychoacoustics; the cognitive neuroscience of music; relationships between music and language; the nature of musical knowledge; and debates about aesthetics, evolutionary psychology, and musical universals. At the end of this course a student should be able to identify key theories and hypotheses in music cognition as they relate to memory, emotion, physiology, neurology, acoustics, language, and evolution. They will be able to comparatively evaluate hypotheses and place them in an intellectual context. These objectives will be achieved though critical reading, discussions, and written exercises. There are no prerequisites for this course.

86718,Brain Computation,"How does the brain work? Understanding the brain requires sophisticated theories to make sense of the collective actions of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses. Word theories are not enough; we need mathematical theories. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the mathematical theories of learning and computation by neural systems. These theories use concepts from dynamical systems (attractors, chaos) and concepts from statistics (information, uncertainty, inference) to relate the dynamics and function of neural networks. We will apply these theories to sensory computation, learning and memory, and motor control.

80100,Introduction to Philosophy,"Even philosophers have a hard time explaining what exactly philosophy is. Instead of attempting a definition, one might instead list some of the questions philosophers try to answer. Like most other academic fields, philosophy has its own sub-disciplines, and each of these has its own questions it tries to answer. In this course, we will be looking at questions from several of these areas of philosophy, including: What is the mind? Do we have free will? What does the answer to that question mean for practices of reward and punishment? Is morality relative? What, if anything, is its connection to religion? How can I know the right thing to do? How can I know anything? This class isn't a historical introduction to philosophy, and we will be jumping around through history and subjects as we please, concerned only with interesting questions and good answers. As a whole, the course will strongly emphasize some of the basic skills of doing just about any kind of philosophy: how to recognize and understand arguments, how to evaluate them, and how to construct your own. As it turns out, these are skills you need to successfully navigate your way through just about any field of study and any career. This course will include a fair amount of writing, but you'll be getting lots of help from me, from your TA, and even from your peers.","['philosophy', 'mind', 'free will', 'morality', 'knowledge', 'argument', 'subjects']",philosophy,intro
80130,Introduction to Ethics,"Philosophical ethics, or moral philosophy, covers a lot of ground. It asks and tries to answer questions like: What's good in life? What matters? What should I (and others) do? How should I (and others) act? What kinds of things out there must be treated ethically? Do we have moral duties to (at least some) non-human animals? Is morality subjective? Are there actually any objective moral truths? Morally speaking, what (if anything) is the difference between killing someone, and simply letting them die? In trying to answer these questions (and others), we'll engage in some wonderfully weird thought experiments, class discussions, smaller group discussions, debates, etc. We'll study and critique several moral theories which try to explain and help guide our moral judgments, and we'll try to apply these theories to real-life moral controversies. Past classes covered topics including drug prohibition, abortion, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. This is an introductory philosophy class, so you'll be learning how to read, critique, do, and write philosophy generally, not just ethics. Considerable time and effort, both in lectures and in recitations, will be spent helping you learn to recognize and evaluate philosophical arguments, as well as empowering you to create, improve, and defend your own arguments in class assignments.","['ethics', 'moral philosophy', 'philosophical ethics', 'good life', 'moral duties', 'non-human animals', 'moral subjectivity', 'objective moral truths', 'drug prohibition']",philosophy,intro
80135,Introduction to Political Philosophy,"At the heart of political philosophy lie fundamental questions such as: What constitutes a just society? How, and under what circumstances do individuals incur political obligations to a particular state? This course provides a systematic investigation of the way such questions are answered by dominant schools of liberal political theory, such as the social contract tradition, utilitarianism and libertarianism. Later we will introduce critiques from socialist, and feminist theorists. Readings are drawn from classic works by authors such as Plato, Hobbes and Locke, and from the works of more contemporary theorists like Rawls, and Nozick.","['just society', 'political obligations', 'social contract', 'utilitarianism', 'libertarianism', 'socialist critique', 'feminist critique', 'plato', 'hobbes', 'locke']",philosophy,intro
80150,Nature of Reason,"How do we demonstrate to each other the truth of what we are saying? How do we infer from our past experiences and observations what we can expect to see in the future? How do we correct our expectations when faced with new evidence? And how can symbolic and mechanical systems assist us in such tasks? Whenever we reason about a subject, including when we write an essay for school or take an exam, our minds have to maneuver an array of their own distinctive capabilities and limitations: imagination, volition, motivation, memory, learning, association, decision, expression, communication, skills, passions, fears, and biases to name a few. Reasoning is a complex undertaking and throughout the history of science and philosophy people have explored ways to improve it. One such improvement is the externalization of reasoning from our minds into symbolic representations and mechanical devices to assist our capabilities and mitigate our limitations. In this class students will learn to use the basics of some such systems and use formal logic and mathematical models to solve problems and discover the features of those systems. From ancient logic to medieval proof machines, early modern scientific methods, and the current advent of artificial intelligence, each innovation comes with its own particular purposes as well as its own significant capabilities and limitations.","['truth', 'inference', 'past experiences', 'future expectations', 'evidence', 'symbolic systems', 'mechanical devices', 'logic', 'mathematical models']",philosophy,intro
80180,Introduction to Linguistics,"Language is used to talk about the world or to describe it, but how do we go about describing language itself? Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description. The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them. Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language.","['linguistics', 'language']",philosophy,intro
80198,Research Training in Philosophy,"The Dietrich College research training program is open to second-semester first-year students and sophomores with a 3.0 QPA or by petition. It is designed to give eligible and interested students some real research experience working on a faculty project or lab in ways that might stimulate and nurture the students' interest in doing more research. The projects take the form of a one-semester/9-unit research apprenticeship with a faculty sponsor. Faculty members are expected to meet with the student regularly and provide a grade. The benefit to faculty is some potentially quite useful research assistance, where projects can be broken down into manageable chunks (e.g., literature reviews). The Phonetics/Phonology Interface & Typology (Ph2IT) Lab conducts production and perception experiments on human speech to better understand cross-linguistic similarities and differences in the speech systems of the world's languages. Research assistants can be involved in running research participants and analysing phonetic data. Prior experience with linguistics and/or speech analysis is beneficial, but highly motivated students can be trained within the lab. If interested, please email Dr. Christina Bjorndahl, at cbjorn@andrew.cmu.edu.","['phonetics', 'phonology', 'typology', 'speech perception', 'research assistant', 'production experiments', 'linguistics', 'speech analysis', 'faculty sponsorship']",philosophy,intro
80210,Logic and Proofs,"This web-based course introduces students to central issues in logic and develops their ability for constructing and refuting arguments. It addresses the question: How can one analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation? An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic. Presentation: The material is presented on-line, though some exercises must be done with pen and paper. Additional reading of historical and philosophical character complements the systematic on-line presentation. Weekly small discussion meetings with collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections supplement the on-line material.","['logic', 'proofs', 'argumentation', 'rational discourse', 'logical structure', 'sentential logic', 'quantificational logic', 'inference rules', 'logical form', 'argumentation strategies']",philosophy,intro
80221,Philosophy of Social Science,"This course will explore numerous philosophical issues that arise in the practice of various social sciences. One central question of the course is whether we can use traditional scientific reasoning to understand social phenomena, e.g. social inequalities, violence, changes in politics, discriminary practices, ecnomic forcasting, etc. in the same way that we use them to understand natural phenomena, e.g. gases, organisms, protein structure, and planetary orbits. Some of the more specific questions we address are: Because humans possess free will and act with intentions while light rays and planets in motion do not, are we forced to use different kinds of explanations in the two cases? How can we explain social institutions that depend upon cooperation when there considerable pyschological evidence that cooperation doesn't help us in achieving our own personal goals? Whereas natural scientists actively conduct experiments, social scientists can often only collect statistical and qualitative data. Does this difference prevent social scientists from inferring causal relations and laws of social behavior? Is our understanding of social phenomena always value laden given that values are an inherent aspect of social life?","['philosophy', 'social science', 'social phenomena', 'free will', 'intentions', 'cooperation', 'psychology', 'experimentation', 'causal relations']",philosophy,intro
80226,The Nature of Scientific Revolutions,"Science is an ever-changing enterprise. Most scientific advances, though significant, occur within a stable framework of accepted theories and data. A few episodes of change in the history of science involve discarding and replacing fundamental theories of the world. These are often accompanied by significant changes in the vocabulary in which those theories are expressed, the tools used by scientists, the phenomena on which scientists focus, and the kinds of explanations they consider acceptable. A very small number of these episodes change the way humanity views its ability to know the natural world and its place in the universe. The latter two kinds of change in science have often been called ""scientific revolutions."" We will focus on three such radical transformations: The ""Copernican Revolution"" (or ""the Scientific Revolution"") of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Darwinian revolution of the 19th century, and the quantum revolution of the late 19th and 20th centuries. This course has two intertwined components: history of science and philosophy of science. In the historical component, we will examine in some detail the three major scientific revolutions. The philosophical components will help us understand the reasoning involved in scientific theory change. This course does not require detailed knowledge of any of the sciences used in examples of revolutionary change.","['science', 'revolutions', 'history', 'philosophy', 'change', 'theories', 'data', 'vocabulary', 'tools', 'phenomena']",philosophy,intro
80234,Philosophy of Race and Gender,"Race and gender, along with their interfaces and interactions with such other social identities as sexuality, (dis)ability, and class, structure our experience of almost every aspect of our social and political reality. Philosophers approach these kinds of social identities from a variety of perspectives. They ask what these kinds of social categories really are, what they mean for the ways we live our lives and the ways we perceive and understand the world, how they have (mis)informed our theoretical and practical understanding of the nature of justice and political power, and what is owed to those affected by racial and gendered injustice. This course uses these questions about race and gender to help introduce students to different areas of philosophy and the analytical tools these areas give us to help understand our world, while also using these different tools from philosophy to help us to understand what race and gender are, how they impact us as knowers, and how our identities function to structure our experience of social reality.","['race', 'gender', 'social identity', 'philosophy', 'justice', 'political power', 'social reality', 'analytical tools', 'knowledge']",philosophy,intro
80245,Medical Ethics,"This course provides a detailed introduction to core ethical issues in medical ethics and public policy. Topics include: the moral responsibilities of health care providers to patients and various third parties such as the government or insurance companies, the status of health as a social good, questions of justice in access to health care, and questions of individual liberty and social responsibility at the ends of life including issues such as cloning, abortion, physician assistance in dying, and the definition of death. We will also examine specific ethical issues in the conduct of medical research and look at the impact of technological innovation on our notions of health, disease, life, death, and the family. While the course engages such substantive ethical issues it also attempts to sharpen students' skills in practical reasoning through argument analysis, analogical reasoning, and the application of theory and principles to practical cases.","['medical ethics', 'health care providers', 'moral resp0nsibilities', 'social good', 'justice', 'individual liberty', 'social responsibility', 'abortion']",philosophy,intro
80249,"AI, Society, and Humanity","The course is divided into three parts. The first part centers on the foundational question of the field of AI: ""Can machines think?"" We will consider an operationalization of the question---the Turing Test---and a philosophical criticism thereof---the Chinese Room Argument. Along the way, we will encounter the principles governing digital computers and artificial neural networks. The next part is on the impacts of AI on society. We will investigate in what sense machine learning algorithms can be said to be ""unfair"" or ""discriminatory"". We will discuss the black box problem---the problem that we often don't understand how the output of a machine learning model came about. Further topics include the risks posed by large language models, fake news, echo chambers, twitter aka X, and other threats to democracy. The last part is on the potential impacts of AI on humanity. We will discuss whether humanity is at risk due to the singularity---an anticipated explosion of artificial intelligence such that some AI systems surpass human-level intelligence. Does such a superintelligence pose an existential risk to humanity? What is the probability that we are doomed in the wake of artificial superintelligence? Can we change this probability by aligning AI with human values? These are but some of the core questions we will tackle.","['ai', 'philosophy', 'turing test', 'chinese room argument', 'digital computers', 'artific0 neural networks', 'fairness', 'discrimination', 'black box problem']",philosophy,intro
80251,Modern Philosophy,"This class will focus on the history of Western philosophy in the modern period, with special emphasis on the ""early modern"" era of roughly 1600-1800. Massive upheavals and conflicts in science, politics, and religion fueled attempts to find new ways of making sense of the world, and we will try to situate our philosophers within this rapidly evolving intellectual context. In particular, we will examine the impact of these changes on two subfields of philosophy: metaphysics (the study of the nature of reality, distinguishing it from mere appearance), and epistemology (roughly, the study of knowledge itself). We will ask, and attempt answers for, questions like: What is knowledge, can we achieve it, and if so, to what extent? To what extent, if any, can our most basic scientific instruments, the human senses, lead us to the true nature of the world? These questions will unavoidably send us down paths into other subfields, like philosophies of mind, of free will, of ethics, and of religion. After reading early modern philosophers like René Descartes, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, we will turn to some more recent work in the modern and contemporary eras to see what lessons (if any) were learned, and what new approaches (if any) have been taken in the quest for knowledge and reality.","['modern philosophy', 'western philosophy', 'early modern era', 'metaphysics', 'epistemology', 'knowledge', 'reality', 'senses', 'philosophy of mind']",philosophy,intro
80260,Dangerous Ideas in Psychiatry,"One day in 19th century France a young man abandons his workplace at a local gas company, wanders off into one general direction without saying goodbye to his loved ones, and winds up on a different continent with little memory of his travels. Soon others follow, not to the same destination but scattered to various foreign lands and cities, enough to cause a short-lived epidemic of compelled vagrancy that would spread from France to Italy, Germany, and Russia before wearing off and leaving the clinical textbooks again. What could it mean for a mental illness to be ""real"" if it only exists for a time and place? Can things like a particular immigration policy or the popularization of the bicycle contribute to the explanation or even the cause of a diagnosed medical condition? And do people in different societies experience a serious condition like schizophrenia differently? In this class we will study cases in psychiatry that are both politically and scientifically controversial. We will look primarily at culture-bound syndromes which can be specific to certain societies, demographics, countries, and even certain times in history. The class will be centered around individual student projects. You will get to choose a relevant medical phenomenon and explore it from scientific, philosophical, and historical angles throughout the course of the class. I will provide a pool of suitable topics for you to pick from. You are most welcome to suggest a relevant topic that you found yourself. There will be no exams. Instead, there will be a steady and moderate workload in the form of weekly and biweekly assignments pertaining to our readings and your projects so you can receive continuous feedback on how well you apply the general concepts of this class to the individual cases you chose.","['dangerous', 'ideas', 'psychiatry', 'one', '19th', 'century', 'france', 'young']",philosophy,intro
80285,Natural Language Syntax,"This course regards modern linguistics as a set of powerful tools for understanding and using language, and among all the subfields of linguistics, syntax as one of the most powerful. There are, however, many approaches to syntax so how should one choose which syntax to study? In 1957, Chomsky published Syntactic Structures, building on earlier research but at the same time providing a novel approach to age-old problems in linguistics, particularly the productivity problem and the learning problem. (How do speakers produce and understand novel sentences, and how do children learn without being taught?) While it is true that the field has progressed far since 1957, Syntactic Structures still stands out for its simplicity and usefulness. In this course we look at how more recent developments in syntax can be reconciled with this earlier approach. Particular focus is on how students can use syntax, in learning other languages and in refining their own use of language.","['syntax', 'linguistics', 'chomsky', 'syntactic structures', 'language production', 'language comprehension', 'language acquisition']",philosophy,intro
80306,Decision Theory,"How should rational agents choose under uncertainty? This mixed-level (graduate & undergraduate) course introduces the main frameworks for decision-making along with key debates between Causal, Evidential, Functional, and Updateless decision theories. We examine justifications for expected utility maximization and probabilistic reasoning. Paradoxes and alternatives theories of uncertainty and risk are considered. In addition, we will use the tools of decision theory to examine pressing puzzles in AI alignment. Students will gain the tools to understand, apply, and critique competing theories of rational choice.","['uncertainty', 'rational agents', 'expected utility', 'decision theory', 'ai alignment', 'causal theories', 'evidential theories']",philosophy,intermediate
80311,Undecidability and Incompleteness,"U & I focuses on two fundamental results: the undecidability of logic (established by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing) and the incompleteness of mathematical theories (discovered by Kurt Gödel). The proofs of these results require a novel metamathematical perspective, but also striking logical concepts and fascinating mathematical techniques. In this course, the theorems are not just formulated but actually proved. We begin with the axiomatic development of elementary set theory that allows, at the same time, the formal representation of informal mathematics like number theory. With this basis, one can show that syntactic notions concerning set theory are representable in the very theory. It is then easy to prove that set theory is incomplete. To show that logic is undecidable, the crucial concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The two central concepts - proof and computation - are fundamental for mathematics, computer science and, in particular, artificial intelligence. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic to the foundations of mathematics. They provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

It is connected to sophisticated philosophical perspectives and also to fundamental views in the sciences. Those perspectives and views have changed in revolutionary ways; so, has mathematics. The common view that mathematics - if not directly ""static"" - is evolving in a linear fashion, does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual changes concerning the very nature and object of mathematics. We examine three episodes in the recent past that reflect radical transformations of the subject. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but are rooted in the past and impact the present. They are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The three episodes are deeply connected and paved the way to traditional and generative AI. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry through arithmetic to set theory as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodology of mathematics - when joined with contemporaneous logical developments - underlies the formalization of mathematics and is at the center of the second episode. Given Turing's analysis of ""formal or mechanical methods"", the question ""How much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines?"" is addressed in the third part.

80315,Logics for Knowledge and Belief,"Standard logical languages can express negation (""not p""), conjunction (""p and q""), material implication (""if p then q""), quantification (""for all x, p(x)""), etc. But they don't directly capture statements like the following: ""Alice knows p."" ""Henceforth, it will be the case that p."" ""It ought to be the case that p."" ""If it had been the case that p, it would have been the case that q."" ""Everybody knows p."" ""Everybody knows that everybody knows p."" ""Infinitely often in the future, p will be true."" ""After an announcement of p, it will be the case that Alice knows q."" ""If p is not permitted, then you ought to know that p is not permitted."" etc. Modal logic is a very general framework for systematically reasoning about statements like these. This course is an introduction to mathematical modal logic and its applications in philosophy, computer science, linguistics, and economics, with emphasis on epistemic interpretations (i.e., logics for representing and reasoning about knowledge/belief). We begin with a rigorous development of propositional modal logic: the basic language, interpretation in relational structures, axiom systems, proofs, and validity. We prove soundness and completeness of various systems using the canonical model method and study model equivalence and expressivity results. We also consider topological semantics as an alternative to relational semantics, and investigate the connection between the two. In the latter part of the course we turn our attention to more specialized logical systems and their applications, as determined by the interests of the class. Topics may include: quantified modal logic, multi-agent systems and the notion of common knowledge (with applications to game theory), temporal and dynamic logics for (nondeterministic) program execution, logics for reasoning about counterfactuals, public announcement logic, deontic logic, intuitionistic logic, and others.","['modal logic', 'knowledge', 'belief', 'epistemic interpretations', 'propositional modal logic', 'axiom systems', 'proofs', 'validity', 'soundness', 'completen0ness']",philosophy,intermediate

80447,Seminar in Global Justice,"Until fairly recently, the dominant view of international relations has been that the governments and citizens of one country have no, or extremely few, obligations to those beyond their borders. With the rapid growth in globalization has come a drastic shift in attitudes about our moral and political obligations to those with whom we share global institutions of trade and finance but neither legal systems nor national identities. This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global distributive justice in the context of neoliberal globalization, with emphases on both theoretical accounts of justice and the practical implications of those accounts for important current global issues. In addition to familiarizing students with contemporary debates within global justice, this course aims to help students strengthen their skills in analytic reading, interpretation, and writing.

80488,"Acoustics of Human Speech: Theory, Data, and Analysis","In this course, students will learn how to acoustically analyse human speech, and in so doing, will learn about both universal and language-particular acoustic characteristics of human speech. The class, which will comprise both lectures and a lab component, will introduce the basic principles of the physics of sound and how the source spectrum is modified by the vocal tract, but the focus throughout will be towards developing a solid understanding of how to perform the relevant analyses. Each week will introduce a new topic, chosen to exemplify a particular acoustic phenomenon. Lectures for that week will provide the theoretical basis for understanding the phenomenon, both in terms of acoustic theory and in articulatory terms. The lab for that week will provide students with relevant acoustic data to analyse using PRAAT, an open-source software used for acoustic analysis. Potential topics include: What does it mean to say someone speaks with ""vocal fry"", and how do we measure this? Why do children replace [r] with [w]? How can we compare sounds in two different languages? For example, what are the acoustic characteristics of [r] and [l] in English and Japanese, such that these sounds count as two different sounds in English, but are so similar in Japanese? What makes an [s] so noisy compared to an [f]? What happens to speech sounds when we talk quickly, or when we're sick and our nose is stuffed up? At the conclusion of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the acoustic characteristics of human speech, both in terms of the underlying theory and how to measure such phenomena. Further, they will be able to translate questions about speech into measurable acoustic variables. There is no prerequisite for this course. While technical material will be covered, no background in linguistics, acoustics, physics, or math is assumed, and all required skills will be taught as needed.","['acoustic analysis', 'speech acoustics', 'vocal tract', 'praat', 'acoustic phenomena', 'linguistics', 'articulatory', 'sound spectrum', 'acoustic data', 'speech sounds']",philosophy,intermediate

A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a category determined by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Geometric logic is treated categorically by the theory of Grothendieck topoi. We shall see how this idea connects logic with topology: the models of a theory form a sort of generalized space. A prerequisite for this course is familiarity with basic category theory (as treated in the course 80-413/713).","['category theory', 'logic', 'computer science', 'functorial semantics', 'syntax-invariant', 'algebraic methods', 'universal models', 'topoi', 'grothendieck', 'topology']",philosophy,advanced
80516,Causality and Machine Learning,"In the past decades, significant progress has been made in tackling long-standing causality problems, such as discovering causality from observational data and inferring causal effects. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the causal perspective aids in understanding and solving various machine learning problems such as transfer learning, out-of-distribution prediction, disentanglement, representation learning, and adversarial vulnerability. Accordingly, this course is concerned with understanding causality, learning it from observational data, and using it to tackle other learning problems. The course covers representations of causal models, how causality is different from association, methods for causal discovery and causal representation learning, and how causality enhances advanced learning tasks, including generative AI. We will address the following questions. Why is causality essential? How can we learn it, including latent variables, from observational data? What role does causality play in learning under data heterogeneity? Can causal principles make generative AI more controllable and capable of extrapolation? How can deep learning benefit from a causal perspective? Two main causality problems are emphasized. One is causal discovery or causal representation learning. It is well known that ""correlation does not imply causality,"" but we will make it more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal relations may happen among the underlying hidden variables—we will also see how to uncover the underlying hidden ""causal"" variables as well as their causal relations from the measured variables. The other is how to properly make use of causal information. This includes identification of causal effects, counterfactual reasoning, and improving machine learning with causal knowledge.","['causality', 'causal discovery', 'causal inference', 'causal effects', 'generative ai']",philosophy,advanced

The purpose of this exploratory seminar is to get a handle on these different approaches in order to better understand the connections between them, their relative strengths and weaknesses (and appropriate use cases), and promising avenues for further development and research.

80604,Formal Methods: Automated Proof Search: Human-Centered,"The course is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in philosophy, computer science, and mathematics with deep interests in interactive theorem proving and automated proof search. The first third of the course presents a logical calculus that is, so one of its inventors claimed, ""as close to mathematical reasoning as possible"" (Gentzen). This natural deduction calculus is being used widely as the logical framework for the ""natural formalization"" of mathematical proofs, be they constructive or classical. Some important examples will be discussed. In the second third of the course the calculus itself is being investigated. With novel techniques, so-called ""normal form theorems"" will be established for the calculus in its constructive and classical version: Any proof can be transformed into a ""normal"" one. The special structural features of normal proofs will be shown. The last third of the course exploits these structural features for the interactive construction and automated search for proofs. The latter is strategically guided and produces well-structured proofs that are humanly intelligible. It is in this sense that the search procedure provides a computational model of aspects of human mathematical reasoning: The automated search is human-centered. The course's content lies in the intersection of mathematical logic, computer science, and mathematics. However, it is deeply connected to an analysis of mathematical experience and to methodological problems in the foundations of mathematics. There will be discussions and readings on these historical and philosophical issues.","['formal methods', 'automated proof search', 'natural deduction calculus', 'constructive mathematics', 'classical mathematics', 'normal form theorems', 'structural features', 'computational model']",philosophy,advanced

Massive upheavals and conflicts in science, politics, and religion fueled attempts to find new ways of making sense of the world, and we will try to situate our philosophers within this rapidly evolving intellectual context. In particular, we will examine the impact of these changes on two subfields of philosophy: metaphysics (the study of the nature of reality, distinguishing it from mere appearance), and epistemology (roughly, the study of knowledge itself). We will ask, and attempt answers for, questions like: What is knowledge, can we achieve it, and if so, to what extent? To what extent, if any, can our most basic scientific instruments, the human senses, lead us to the true nature of the world? These questions will unavoidably send us down paths into other subfields, like philosophies of mind, of free will, of ethics, and of religion. After reading early modern philosophers like René Descartes, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, we will turn to some more recent work in the modern and contemporary eras to see what lessons (if any) were learned, and what new approaches (if any) have been taken in the quest for knowledge and reality.","['modern philosophy', 'western philosophy', 'early modern era', 'metaphysics', 'epistemology', 'knowledge', 'reality', 'senses', 'philosophy of mind']",philosophy,advanced

Second, you should acquire sufficient proficiency with some of the techniques that you can use them as an ""end user modeler"". Third, you should learn how to approach, abstract, and analyze problems from a quantitative, analytical perspective. In short, you should be able to use the language of mathematical modeling. In most lectures we will work through a small ""case"" to help you connect the methods to a problem that is richer than the typical end of chapter problem. Fourth, doing these things will prepare you to manage staff who are doing analytics projects. Walking a mile in their shoes (reflectively), will help you understand what they can and cannot do to create value for your organization. The course moves quickly; be careful not to fall behind.

90440,Critical Analysis of Policy Research,"This course is not intended for Heinz College graduate level students. Heinz graduate students should register for the corresponding graduate course 90-822. This course is intended for undergraduate students who are in their third year or later. This course prepares students to understand, interpret, and critique existing policy research. The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation.","['policy analysis', 'empirical research', 'causal inference', 'graphical methods', 'research evaluation', 'undergraduate education', 'third-year students', 'research critique']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
90445,Social Entreprenuership,"With a world threatened by rising inequalities (especially in the post-pandemic time) and the effects of climate change, we are in the middle of an era where we are seeing the growth of social entrepreneurship - both in the upsurge of new ventures and within corporations as they seek to respond to demand from their consumers and the public toward a focus not solely on profit, but on a ""triple bottom line"" - an equivalent focus on PURPOSE -- people and the planet. This course is for students that want to learn how to take ideas that respond to societal needs and frame it within a sustainable business structure. Ideas may be for new social ventures or innovations within existing institutions and corporations. The students will work on an idea they have and take it through a model ""accelerator"" program curriculum. Accelerators are ""fixed-term cohort-based programs that include seed investment, mentorship,"" a curriculum that aims to fast forward business planning and strategy and culminate in what is typically called ""demo day"" - an opportunity for participating teams to present to potential investors. The course is open to students from different disciplines. This course will utilize online resources as well as readings culled from leading resources on lean business planning. It is an applied learning course and will require working practical knowledge of basic financial statements. At the end of the course, students will be able to take an idea through a model accelerator curriculum - from establishing a mission, vision, theories of change and impact pathways to market and competitive analysis, identifying target markets, customer acquisition, basic financial modeling to crafting the pitch deck.

90822,Critical Analysis of Policy Research,"This course prepares students to understand, interpret, and critique existing policy research. The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation. Note that the posted syllabus is for a mini-length version of the course. Moving forward, the course will be semester-long. The material covered will be very similar, but with more detail, supplementary topics, and more opportunities for students to practice their skills prior to the culminating final project.","['policy analysis', 'critical evaluation', 'empirical research', 'causal inference', 'statistical bias', 'research critique', 'graphical methods', 'assumption assessment', 'research flaws', 'student practice']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90823,Program Evaluation,"In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the program's design and implementation, and ultimately the program's impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the program's merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making. Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading. This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.","['program evaluation', 'social science methods', 'program design', 'program implementation', 'program impact', 'program merit', 'program worth', 'program significance']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90824,Cost Benefit Analysis,"Individuals and organizations are frequently presented with decisions about how best to allocate limited resources. Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security. Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms. Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty. The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis. Learning Objectives Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to: Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies. Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses. Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses. Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others. Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics. Communicate the results of the cost-benefit analysis to stakeholders in such a way as to facilitate political or administrative processes. Prerequisites Students must have completed EITHER 90-709 Intermediate Economic Analysis OR 90-710 Applied Economic Analysis, as well as 90-711 Empirical Methods.","['-cost-benefit analysis', '-economics', '-resource allocation', '-policy priorities', '-quantitative analysis', '-monetary terms', '-future valuation', '-risk reduction']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90826,Education Policy and Reform in the U.S.,"This course will provide an overview of the central ideas of education policy reform in the United States. We will examine policy decisions at the local, state, and federal levels and their impacts on learning and teaching. Guiding this course, there are two main objectives: 1. To build a framework for how policies of various types may support or hinder teaching and learning in K-12 classrooms - through which mechanism do policies affect the classroom? 2. To critically explore evidence concerning the effects of policies on teaching and learning - what is the impact on the classroom? To understand the relationship between policy decisions and classroom success, we survey topics such as school governance and choice, school accountability, curriculum and standards reform, teacher and principal workforce, and school resources. In addition to the local, state, and federal policies that address these topics, this class will also explore recent research evaluating these policies. To further explore the viability of these policy reforms and their likelihood of bringing about lasting and positive change to classrooms across the country, we will spend time comparing and evaluating the analytic methods and research designs that investigate the impacts of policies on student learning outcomes and teaching practice. Due to the decentralized nature of the United States education system, we will supplement our impact evaluation evidence base with robust qualitative and descriptive work to evaluate the generalizability of each policy to different contexts.","['education policy', 'reform', 'k-', 'school governance', 'accountability', 'curriculum', 'standards', 'workforce']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90834,Geospatial Health Analytics,"This course is taught with asynchronous video lectures and readings with in-person and remote office hours. A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical record data, environmental health, social services, and other location data. Public health departments, hospitals, and medical research agencies are using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It involves learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes lectures and computer labs that focus on a health, technical, or policy issue which use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create Story Maps and Dashboards to convey their maps and associated text to the public and decision makers. Through assignments and projects students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health data. Prerequisites: 90-728 Introduction to Database Management, 91-802 Information Systems for Managers or permission of instructor.","['geospatial health analytics', 'gis', 'public health', 'disease clusters', 'environmental health', 'health data', 'arcgis pro', 'health policy', 'data visualization']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90836,Health Systems,"Health Policy and Delivery Systems is a foundation course intended to introduce students to many of the broad subjects that will be detailed in more advanced course work. This introduction provides a framework to aid students in navigating from public policy through to healthcare delivery. Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality, and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy. Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links the external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals, and outcomes.","['health policy', 'healthcare delivery', 'public policy', 'healthcare reform', 'health systems', 'healthcare profitability', 'healthcare access', 'healthcare quality', 'healthcare outcomes']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90843,Development Financial Tools for Sustainable Economic Development,"Course dates: March 15 & 16, 2025. Economic development is driven largely by funding and financing opportunities. Nearly every redevelopment, business expansion, community facility and infrastructure project hinges on the availability of affordable, patient and flexible capital. When addressing sustainability in economic development, funding and finance are even more critical. The lack of funding and finance can result in the ability for projects and programs to move forward in an effective manner. From the bedrock tools like bonds and targeted tool like tax increment to tax credit investment and access to capital lending programs, the development finance toolbox provides financing options that cover the entire development continuum. Unlocking the Development Finance Toolbox to Support Sustainable Economic Development will explore the intersection of development, sustainability and finance with an in depth review of the financing tools that catalyze and drive job growth and economic expansion. This course will not only explore the tools behind effective development but also examine success projects and programs that are driving communities towards a sustainable future.","['development finance', 'economic development', 'sustainable development', 'financing tools', 'capital availability', 'tax credit investment', 'access to capital', 'development continuum', 'job growth']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90845,Social Entrepreneurship,"The social-impact Lean Innovation Lab (""Social Entrepreneurship"") is a continuation of the course Entrepreneurship: A New Venture, designed to challenge students to tackle longstanding and emerging problems across the Learn-Earn-Career landscape (i.e. the Future of Work, Learning, Connection, and Opportunity). Students will have the option to select from a set of carefully curated, complex and real-world problem set(s) and/or introduce their own problem sets within the thematic focus. Students will be presented with the option of working as an embedded ""frontend innovator"" within an established organization (driving new-product and corporate innovation) or developing a solution to their problem statement as an independent new startup venture. Students will learn to apply lean innovation frameworks and tools to develop a foresight positioning and data-driven thesis and will use applied anthropology, ethnography, and quantitative analysis to develop conviction for an idea through the business invention process. A central component to the Innovation Lab is learning to synthesize and apply concepts and techniques from the Innovation Studio Process framework and across three distinctive phases: Phase I: Venture Design Rapid, systematic approach to research, define, envision and assess the best path forward for a new venture, product, service or experience.

90873,"Local Policy Power, Context, and Impact","Have you ever wondered why some cities, like Washington, D.C., have thousands of permitted dockless electric scooters, while Pittsburgh once had 1,000 and now has zero? Cities and towns across the country are experimenting with bold policy initiatives. A new bike network promises safe travel for all ages, a climate plan commits to cutting emissions, and a housing ordinance seeks to protect affordability. Local nonprofits mobilize for equity, business groups push for growth, and community members raise their voices in debates about who benefits and who bears the costs. But while the announcements are ambitious, the outcomes often depend on a simple set of questions: Who is the champion? What is the context? What impact will it have? This course equips students with the frameworks, tools, and experiences needed to turn local policy into action. We will examine the political, financial, and community contexts that shape decision-making; study the role of champions in advancing initiatives; and practice measuring both the positive and negative impacts of local policies. While every place is unique- many of the variables that influence decision-making and investment are shared. Nobody has all of the answers- but this course will teach students how to ask the right questions and how decisions are made in the absence of perfection. Students will learn to anticipate risks and design strategies to make initiatives succeed, while also mapping out the roles of local governments, nonprofits, and business improvement districts. Case studies—including a comparison of Washington, DC and Pittsburgh—will ground these lessons in real-world practice. Instruction will combine interactive lectures, discussions, and applied exercises, with assessments modeled on professional practice: policy memos, stakeholder engagement maps, and impact analyses.","['local policy', 'context', 'impact', 'community', 'initiatives', 'champions', 'measurement', 'strategies', 'risk']",public policy & social sciences,advanced

Why are experiments such a powerful tool both inside and outside of academia? Why do organizations—from startups to established tech giants to national governments—rely so heavily on experimentation to innovate, optimize, and make strategic decisions? This course is designed to equip you with the theoretical understanding and the practical tools needed to design, implement, and interpret experiments of your own. We'll develop these skills by showcasing real-world experiments tackling pressing questions, such as company pricing, recommendation algorithms, online advertising, employee recruitment and motivation, vaccine uptake, and discrimination by both employers and customers. By the end of the course, you should be able to design and run your own experiment, analyze data from them, and make evidence-based recommendations based on the causal evidence you have collected. You should also have a better understanding of the role of experiments in the scientific process and as a tool for decision-making even outside of academia. This is a valuable skill set for anyone looking to make practical, data-driven contributions within organizations, whether in the business, government, or non-profit sector.","['experiment design', 'causal inference', 'data analysis', 'real-world applications', 'organizational innovation', 'empirical research', 'learning process', 'experimental economicsext']",public policy & social sciences,advanced
90894,Federal Budget Policy,"Remember that scene in ""The Matrix"" where Neo finally understands his power? He is standing in a hallway confronted by three agents. Instead of seeing the walls of the hallway, and the agents as people, he sees the underlying code running through the walls and the agents. His understanding of the matrix enables him to then manipulate the code to become powerful .In this scene he stops seeing the software constructed world around him and instead sees the code running in the background that creates his reality. That is the goal of this course. To empower you to understand the code that runs the federal government, only in this case we are talking about money, not programming languages. When this course is completed, you will understand and look at the government in a fundamentally different way. You will look at buildings, the people, the programs and see dollar signs running through them. This will enable you to manipulate the code. In other words, by understanding the budget process, you be able to build better programs, manage projects, work with your organization to find resources. In order to bring you to that point, we will learn about how the budget process works, and how an organization obtains and spends money. Furthermore, you will understand how the money was secured and how it is being spent. The goal is for you to look at government differently, and to start seeing the money, not the façade.","['federal budget', 'government finance', 'budget process', 'money management', 'financial transparency', 'organizational resources', 'budget analysis']",public policy & social sciences,advanced

Topics range from neuroscience and the biological basis of behavior, to memory and thought, to social interaction and psychological development over the lifespan, to abnormal psychology, psychopathology, and treatment. Tuesday and Thursday lectures provide a broad survey of topics and findings in psychology. In recitation sections students get hands on experiencing thinking about psychological science by designing and running psychological studies and discussing the real world implications of the concepts they have investigated. While all sections will be completing the same activities, some of the sections are themed. Themed sections will frame the discussion in the context of the theme, thus allowing students in those sections to better appreciate the links between the work being done in the class and the theme of that section. However, the core material will be the same and all sections will prepare students equally well for exams and upper division courses. General (unthemed) sections will sample across themes and topics, rather than being focused on a single theme.

85413,Perception,"Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting. Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it. In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch. We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.","['perception', 'representation', 'external world', 'sensory organs', 'ambiguous world', 'cognitive systems']",psychology,intermediate

85416,Applications of Cognitive Science,"The famous psychologist George Miller once said that Psychology should ""give itself away."" The goal of this course is to look at cases where we have done so -- or at least tried. The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se. That impact can take the form of a product, a change in practice, or a legal statute. The application should have a theoretical base, as contrasted, say, with pure measurement research as in ergonomics. Examples of applications are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors based on models of cognitive processing, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measurses of consumers' implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting. The questions to be considered include: What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable? What is the pathway from laboratory to practice? What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice? The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.

In this course, MRSD students will explore the fundamentals of start-up and new venture creation in the context of robotics and unmanned systems. The explosion in robotics investment in the past 5 years presents many new opportunities and challenges to potential entrepreneurs who are interested in starting their own company. In this class, you will take an idea, based on a subset of your MRSD project, and view it through the lens of product and/or service development. This includes the concept of a ""minimum viable product"" - what is the simplest version of your idea that can be sold, to test the marketplace? To get to this point, however, we will learn about the core fundamentals that go into the decision of what kind of business to build: innovation, business models, marketing, financial analysis, funding options, and exit strategies. In addition, we will spend a lot of time discussing practical strategies and considerations for companies in the robotics space. This course will not teach you everything you need to know to build and run a company. Can't do that in one semester. But you will be exposed to all aspects of company formation and management, with an emphasis on what you need to know to have a potentially successful robotics business. Along the way, we will make heavy use of the ""business model canvas"" concept, which is a relatively new approach to brainstorming and specifying the specifics of a business model - activities, partners, resources, value proposition, customer relationships, customer segments, distribution channels, cost structure, revenue streams, and risks.

16730,Robotics Business,"This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars. The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started. Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward. However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need? This kernel -- extracted from the ""big plan""-- is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity. These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies. In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market. The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business. In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business. To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world. The course is project based. Each student will either build their own business concept, or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business. Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988.

16785,Integrated Intelligence in Robotics: Vision Language Planning,"Recent progress in language models and vision-language models are impressive but similar breakthroughs have not been observed in the field of robotics. Some experts believe it is only a matter of time until enough training data is available for robots to achieve a similar kind of breakthrough observed in language models, while others argue there are critical challenges that data alone would not be able to address, e.g., dexterity, safety, and social intelligence. In this course, we study how we can address those challenges related to robot intelligence. This course covers interdisciplinary topics on cognitive intelligence in robotic systems. Cognitive abilities constitute high-level, humanlike intelligence that exhibits reasoning or problem-solving skills. Such abilities as semantic perception, use of language, and task planning can be built on top of low-level robot autonomy. The topics covered may bridge multiple technical areas, for example, vision-language intersection and language-action/plan grounding. Project Themes Filmmaking presents varied robotics and machine learning challenges ranging from content generation, e.g. scenario generation or scene/video synthesis/editing to robotics automation, e.g. autonomous camera control or autonomous stop-motion control. Arts in Robotics is a fast growing field that connects robotics with humanity such as creativity and compassion. Sample projects include robot painting, robot sculpting, pottery making, etc. Following natural language instructions in navigation or manipulation tasks remain difficult despite the powerful foundation models. This theme encourages the students to design an innovative intelligent architecture that can be a game changer in this fast moving field. The projects on social robots will explore how robots can recognize and understand human emotions or social norms to choose suitable actions/behaviors in various social contexts.","['solution robotics', 'vision-language models', 'cognitive intelligence', 'dexterity', 'safety', 'social intelligence', 'content generation', 'autonomous control', 'creative robotics', 'emotion recognition instruction']",computer science,advanced

In this course, we will learn the fundamentals of topics in machine/deep/visual/reinforcement learning and how such approaches are applied to robot decision-making. We will study fundamentals of 1) machine/deep learning with an emphasis on approaches relevant to robotics; 2) reinforcement learning: model-based, model-free, on-policy (e.g., policy gradients), off-policy (e.g., Q-learning), offline, etc.; 3) imitation learning: behavior cloning, DAgger, inverse RL, etc.; and 4) visual learning geared towards decision making including topics like generative models and their use for robotics.

16832,Special Topic: Integrated Planning and Learning,"Planning has always been one of the central components in autonomy stacks of robotic systems, ranging from self-driving vehicles and autonomous drones to mobile manipulation platforms and quadrupeds to multi-agent robotic systems. Learning-based control such as Deep RL and Imitation Learning has also emerged as one of the powerful, and potentially alternative, approaches to controlling various robotic systems, especially the ones that need to interact with their environment. These two methodologies to robot control have their own strengths and weaknesses but are often complementary. Planning provides strong guarantees on performance and safety but can be computationally intensive and depends heavily on the quality of a model, which is often hard to attain when interaction with environment is involved. Learning-based control is often faster and removes dependency on a model but depends heavily on the adequacy of the training data. This complementarity of the approaches leads to strong interest in combining them, both within academia and industry. This class studies the latest algorithmic approaches to integrated planning and learning. In particular, the class first examines different reasons for combining the two methodologies, from computational reasons to model dependency to the duration of the development cycle of a fielded robotic system. It then studies state-of-the-art research within each group of algorithmic approaches to integrating planning and learning. The course will be structured to have several classes where the instructor teaches the material. The rest of the class, students will be asked to present papers from the list compiled by the instructor. In addition, students will conduct a semester-long research project in the area of integrated planning and learning. The project is supposed to lead to a research paper worthy of publication at a top-tier robotics venue.","['robotics', 'integration', 'control', 'deep rl', 'autonomy', 'safety', 'model dependency']",computer science,advanced
16833,Robot Localization and Mapping,"Robot localization and mapping are fundamental capabilities for mobile robots operating in the real world.

16883,Provably Safe Robotics,"Safe autonomy has become increasingly critical in many application domains. It is important to ensure not only the safety of the ego robot but also the safety of other agents (humans or robots) that directly interact with the au-tonomy. For example: • Robots should be safe for human workers in human-robot collaborative assembly. • Autonomous vehicles should be safe for other road participants. For complex autonomous systems with many degrees of freedom, safe operation depends on the correct function-ing of all system components (e.g., accurate perception, optimal decision making, and safe control). This course addresses both the design and verification of safe robotic systems, focusing on: • Designing safety through control and learning. • Verifying neural components, closed-loop systems, and safety/reachability analyses.","['safe autonomy', 'human-robot collaboration', 'autonomous vehicles', 'system components', 'control', 'verification', 'neural components', 'closed-loop systems']",computer science,advanced
16886,Embodied Artificial Intelligence Safety,"Safety is a nuanced concept. For embodied systems, like robots, we commonly equate safety with collision-avoidance. But out in the ""open world"" it can be much more: for example, a safe mobile manipulator should understand when it is not confident about a requested task and understand that areas roped off by caution tape should never be breached. In this class, we study the question of if (and how) the rise of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models (e.g., deep neural trajectory predictors, large vision-language models, and latent world models) can be harnessed to unlock new avenues for generalizing safety to the open world. From a foundations perspective, we study safety methods from two complementary communities: control theory (which enables the computation of safe decisions) and machine learning (which enables uncertainty quantification and anomaly detection). Throughout the class, there will also be several guest lectures from experts in the field. Students will practice essential research skills including reviewing papers, writing project proposals, and technical communication.","['safety', 'embodied systems', 'robots', 'ai models', 'control theory', 'uncertainty quantification', 'anomaly detection', 'open world', 'guest lectures']",computer science,advanced

To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates.

17647,Engineering Data Intensive Scalable Systems,"Internet services companies such as Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Meta, have pioneered systems that have achieved unprecedented scale while still providing high level availability and a high cost-performance. These systems differ from mainstream high performance systems in fundamental ways. They are data intensive rather than compute intensive. They are also cloud-native distributed systems that are often deployed as microservices and require integration with external systems via networked-based APIs. They need to inherently support scalability, typically having high throughput, security, reliability and availability demands as well. Designing and building these systems require a specialized set of skills. This course will cover design principles and strategies needed to design and implement data intensive scalable distributed systems. In this domain engineers not only need to know how to architect systems that are inherently scalable, but to do so in a way that also supports high availability, reliability, and performance. Given the nature of these systems, basic distributed systems concepts such as time, transparency, data consistency and synchronization are also important. These systems largely operate around the clock, have components running on different nodes and platforms, so the course also emphasizes deployability and operational concerns. The course includes a hands-on project where students get to create and discuss design alternatives, and implement the solutions in a public cloud environment. The basic concepts will be given during the lectures and applied in the project.

Different media lead us to ask different questions, remember (or forget) different information, attend to different details, and interact with other people in different ways. These types of thinking aren't inherently better or worse, but they may be better or worse for facilitating specific goals. Too often, we use a particular medium/technology without considering how it will influence our thinking. This can lead us to be less efficient or less effective at a task than we otherwise might be, or can qualitatively change the nature of our outcomes. In this class, we will explore how the media we use affects the character of our thinking, so as to enable students to make mindful and deliberate choices about how to interact with media in ways that support the type of thinking desired and appropriate for their goals. Moreover, we will examine how to optimize media for specific goals in important applied domains, such as education, medicine, policy, child-rearing, and dating.","['online', 'media', 'influence', 'efficiency', 'effectiveness', 'goals', 'education', 'medicine', 'policy']",public policy & social sciences,intro

Strategic decision making requires a framework to think through the implications of cooperation and of competition. This course gives you a systematic approach to understanding how people, firms, or countries interact with one another to achieve their own goals. We focus on the practical application of theory-based strategic principles and on their behavioral validity (whereas traditional game theory courses usually focus on formal modeling techniques).

However, shifting attitudes does not always change behavior, nor do behavioral shifts always lead to broader social and policy change to bring about societal equity. So, how should we engage in the action needed to address systemic inequality? In this course, students will learn key theories from social psychology, behavioral economics and decision-making, and review research from those disciplines on prejudice and discrimination, including racism, sexism, and classism. With that foundation, students will critically assess policy effectiveness in domains where social inequality persists, including environmental and criminal justice, education, healthcare, housing, and wealth and income. Policies will be examined through readings, podcasts, discussions, and writing activities. In a peer-evaluated final group project, students will propose a policy solution to a specific issue, analyze its efficacy, and present a plan to gain public support for the policy.","['discrimination', 'social inequality', 'behavioral economics', 'social psychology', 'policy analysis', 'education', 'healthcare', 'wealth', 'income']",public policy & social sciences,intro

88312,Decision Models and Games,"Humans often make decisions in changing and uncertain situations. A car driver entering a new city must adjust decisions rapidly while moving along heavy traffic; firefighter crews entering a burning building must maintain awareness of the development of fire; citizens in a country must change their activities based on the evolution of a pandemic and the restrictions imposed. While challenging, humans are an adaptable species. We plan and re-adjust our plans to changing conditions; we keep aware of potentially new courses of action; and we manage our limited time, information, and attention to changing environments. How do humans make decisions in dynamic situations? This course will explore human decision making as a dynamic process resulting from human interactions with the environment. The course uses decision games to illustrate how humans learn and adapt to changing conditions of choice, and computational models to simulate decision processes and environmental dynamics. Decision Models and Games will provide: (1) foundational perspectives for using models to represent the dynamics of environments and human decision processes; (2) tools to build computational models of human decision making and of dynamic environments; and (3) practical illustrations of how models and games can be used to understand and generate solutions to a wide range of decision problems, from simple choices to large scale consequential decisions.","['decision models', 'dynamic environments', 'computational models', 'decision games', 'simulation', 'adaptation', 'awareness']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
88323,Policy in a Global Economy 1: International Trade and Trade Policy,"Across the globe, the longstanding consensus in favor of open trade and investment policies is being called into question. Trade wars are spreading and becoming more intense. Protectionism and industrial policies are being embraced by developed and developing countries alike. Are these shifts appropriate? Will they lead to greater prosperity or make prosperity harder to achieve? This course will give students the tools to answer these qustions. It will focus on the economics of international trade and immigration, providing students with the skills needed to assess trade, industrial, and immigration policies. We will also study the politics of trade and immigration and the roots of the current backlash against globalization. We will study the connection between trade and economic development. We will analyze the rise of trade wars, trade sanctions, and the growing connection between trade policy and considerations of national security. We will also examine policy options for mitigating the costs and more equally distributing the benefits of international trade. Finally, we will consider the implications of climate change for international trade and trade policy.

How can governments achieve and maintain growth and stability in a world where financial chaos seems ready to emerge at any moment from the most unlikely circumstances? How can nations learn the lessons of our turbulent financial and macroeconomic history, so that they are not doomed to repeat it? This course will address these essential questions. This course will teach students the basic conceptual frameworks and models of international macroecoomics. The class will focus on the rise of international capital and financial flows in the post-war era, international macroeconomic policy trade-offs with fixed and floating exchange rates, and the economics of inflation.

88338,Market Design,"Markets are powerful tools for organizing economic activity and distributing economic gains, but they often raise questions about fairness, ethics, and the limits of relying on prices alone. This course introduces students to the field of market design—a branch of economics that asks how rules, institutions, and incentives can be structured to achieve better social outcomes. By discussing historical examples and cutting-edge problems, as well as engaging in market experiments in class, students will learn about markets ranging from medical residency matching to auction design and voting systems. Students will explore and actually experience when markets work well on their own, when they fail, and how thoughtful design can help. The course blends conceptual understanding with light formal modeling, helping students reason rigorously about efficiency, equity, and the role of information in economic systems. Alongside theory, students will examine real-world successes and failures, engaging with ethical dilemmas such as the repugnance of certain transactions, the tradeoffs between efficiency and fairness, and the consequences of imperfect information. By the end, students will be able to critically analyze and propose market rules in settings where ""natural"" outcomes may fall short of society's goals.","['market design', 'economics', 'social outcomes', 'prices', 'fairness', 'ethics', 'incentives', 'auction design', 'voting systems']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate

In this course we will spend the first several classes reviewing the assumptions, implications for public policy, and limitations of the rational choice perspective. We will then examine, and critique, an approach to public policy called ""nudge."" The remainder of the course will then be devoted to examining different public policy issues, including saving, health care, crime and drug abuse, through the competing lenses of traditional and behavioral economics.","['economics', 'public policy', 'rational choice', 'nudge', 'health care', 'crime', 'drug abuse', 'behavioral economics']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
88367,Designing Economics Experiments in the Wild,"Experiments are a critical component of the scientific process and our ability to learn about and improve the world. Why are experiments such a powerful tool both inside and outside of academia? Why do organizations—from startups to established tech giants to national governments—rely so heavily on experimentation to innovate, optimize, and make strategic decisions? This course is designed to equip you with the theoretical understanding and the practical tools needed to design, implement, and interpret experiments of your own. We'll develop these skills by showcasing real-world experiments tackling pressing questions, such as company pricing, recommendation algorithms, online advertising, employee recruitment and motivation, vaccine uptake, and discrimination by both employers and customers. By the end of the course, you should be able to design and run your own experiment, analyze data from them, and make evidence-based recommendations based on the causal evidence you have collected. You should also have a better understanding of the role of experiments in the scientific process and as a tool for decision-making even outside of academia. This is a valuable skill set for anyone looking to make practical, data-driven contributions within organizations, whether in the business, government, or non-profit sector.","['experiment design', 'causal inference', 'data analysis', 'real-world applications', 'organizational innovation', 'empirical research', 'learning process', 'experimental economicsext']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
88384,Underappreciated Ideas in the Social Sciences,"Some great ideas change the world, others change the way you think about the world, and still others vanish into academic obscurity barely making an impact. This course is a treasure hunt for those hidden gems: the theories, frameworks, and findings that could fundamentally reshape how you think about people, groups, and societies but, for whatever reason, haven't hit the big time. We'll cover the quirky, the profound, and the counterintuitive, exploring theories of why societies collapse, why the world can feel worse even as it gets better, and why adding a new highway might actually increase traffic congestion. These aren't the buzzwords you'll hear in every psychology or decision science class—these are the ideas that fall through the cracks but might just blow your mind. Along the way, expect lively debates, a few ""how-did-I-not-know-this?"" moments, and a deeper appreciation for why humans are just so delightfully strange.","['hidden gems', 'social sciences', 'theories', 'frameworks', 'societal collapse', 'traffic congestion', 'quirky ideas', 'counterintuitive', 'lively debates']",public policy & social sciences,intermediate
